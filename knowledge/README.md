# Knowledge Base

This folder contains our running log of learnings, experiment reports, and iteration notes.

## Structure

Files should be named with timestamps for chronological ordering:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-short-description.md
```

Example: `2026-01-18-initial-baseline-results.md`

## What Goes Here

- **Experiment reports**: Results from benchmark runs, what we tested, what we learned
- **Observations**: Patterns noticed across multiple runs
- **Hypotheses**: Ideas to test in future experiments
- **Iteration notes**: Why we changed a prompt strategy or added a feature
- **Dead ends**: What didn't work and why (equally valuable)

## Format Suggestion

```markdown
# [Title]

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Run IDs**: [list relevant benchmark run IDs if applicable]

## Context
What prompted this experiment/observation?

## What We Did
Brief description of the experiment or change.

## Results
Key findings, metrics, observations.

## Takeaways
What we learned. What to try next.
