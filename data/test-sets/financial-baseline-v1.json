The company produces custom precision machined components for aerospace, defense, and industrial equipment manufacturers, with particular expertise in titanium and high-grade aluminum alloy fabrication.\n\n### Business Model & Metrics\n\nThe company operates on a contract manufacturing model with long-term supplier agreements averaging 3-5 years. Current annual revenue is approximately $32M, serving 47 active customers including major aerospace OEMs like Boeing suppliers and defense contractors. Average contract value is $680K annually, with typical lead times of 8-12 weeks for complex components. Despite the traditional manufacturing model, Precision Industries reports exceptional Net Revenue Retention (NRR) of 124%, driven by scope expansion within existing programs and value-added engineering services that increase content per part.\n\n### Team & Funding\n\nThe leadership team includes founder-CEO Robert Martinez, COO Jennifer Walsh (ex-General Electric manufacturing operations), and CFO Michael Chen (formerly VP Finance at Honeywell Aerospace). Total headcount is 187 employees across manufacturing operations (65%), quality assurance (15%), engineering (12%), and administrative functions (8%). The company has been primarily self-funded through operating cash flow, with a single growth capital round of $18M from Benchmark in 2022 to fund facility expansion and advanced CNC equipment.\n\n### Market Position & Competition\n\nPrecision Industries competes in the fragmented $45B precision machining market, serving niche applications requiring AS9100 aerospace certification and ITAR compliance. Key competitors include local and regional machine shops, though few possess the company's combination of metallurgical expertise and quality certifications. The company differentiates through 99.7% on-time delivery rates and proprietary heat treatment processes for titanium components.\n\n### Recent Developments\n\n- Successfully completed facility consolidation, exiting the Phoenix manufacturing location to focus operations in Austin, reducing geographic footprint by 35%\n- Discontinued serving the automotive market segment to concentrate resources on higher-margin aerospace and defense applications\n- Invested $4.2M in new 5-axis CNC machining centers to expand complex geometry capabilities\n- Implemented lean manufacturing initiatives that reduced waste by 18% and improved throughput\n- Secured multi-year supply agreement with Tier 1 aerospace supplier representing $8M in committed revenue over three years\n\nThe strategic market exit and geographic consolidation efforts have allowed management to optimize operational efficiency while maintaining strong customer expansion within core aerospace and defense verticals.",
