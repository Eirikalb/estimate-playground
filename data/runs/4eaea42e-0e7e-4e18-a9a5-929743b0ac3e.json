This location benefits from convenient road access to the E6 motorway, facilitating efficient regional distribution, although the area has limited rail connections. The immediate surroundings are predominantly industrial, featuring a mix of older warehouses and newer logistics facilities, which contribute to the area's overall functionality as a distribution hub. The cadastral designation for this property is gnr. 205, bnr. 14 in Sørum municipality, encompassing an owned plot of 12,300 m².\n\nConstructed in 1998, the building comprises a single-story logistics facility encompassing approximately 6,500 m² BTA. The property features a functional layout optimized for logistics operations, with a clear height of 6 meters and multiple loading docks designed to accommodate various freight vehicles. The building's structure is primarily reinforced concrete, which provides durability and flexibility for various tenant needs. However, the facility shows signs of aging, and significant capital expenditures (capex) are anticipated to modernize the property to meet contemporary logistics standards.\n\nThe tenancy structure currently includes three diverse tenants, ensuring a stable income stream despite an aging building stock. Each tenant operates within the logistics and distribution sectors, capitalizing on the property’s strategic location. The diversified tenant base reflects a healthy demand for space in this secondary logistics area, which is crucial for mitigating vacancy risks and enhancing rental income potential.\n\nRecent technical upgrades to the facility include the installation of new loading dock equipment in 2020, enhancing operational efficiency, and a comprehensive roof refurbishment completed in 2023, which addressed insulation and water tightness issues. However, the rest of the building requires modernization, and the need for additional capex is highlighted by the lack of energy-efficient systems and updated facilities. Currently, the building holds an energy rating of C, indicating room for improvement in sustainability performance.\n\nThe property benefits from a variety of transport connections, including proximity to key arterial roads that facilitate regional logistics operations. Local bus services are available, although rail access is limited in this area, which is not uncommon for secondary logistics locations. Nearby landmarks include the Sørum industrial park and various smaller distribution centers, further solidifying the property's role as a logistical nexus.\n\nThe primary regulatory framework for the property allows for continued use as a logistics facility, with designated areas for storage and distribution cited in the municipal master plan. Future regulatory shifts or infrastructure developments may enhance the appeal of the location, providing an opportunity for growth in rental income and property value.\n\nIn summary, while the property at Lagerveien 42 presents significant opportunities due to its diversified tenant base and strategic location within a secondary logistics area, it is essential to recognize the implications of its older building stock, which necessitates substantial renovation efforts to unlock its full potential. The combination of a well-located property, an established tenant base, and the possibility for modernization could make this an attractive investment for parties interested in the logistics sector.",

Located approximately 3 kilometers from the Drammen railway station and 2 kilometers from the E18 motorway, this site offers advantageous road access for regional distribution, with limited rail connections serving the surrounding logistics network. The immediate vicinity is characterized by older building stock, primarily utilized for warehousing and light industrial activities, reflecting the area’s historical role as a logistics hub. The cadastral designation is gnr. 234, bnr. 45 in Drammen municipality, with an owned plot size of 1,800 m².\n\nConstructed in 1980, this single-story logistics facility encompasses a gross building area of approximately 3,200 m² BTA, featuring a clear ceiling height of 6 meters. The building is a functional concrete structure, designed for optimal operational efficiency, with a layout accommodating a combination of warehouse space and office facilities. The design includes multiple loading bays, enhancing the property's logistical capabilities and facilitating smooth operational workflows. Notable technical upgrades have been completed in recent years, including the installation of a new roof in 2015, replacement of the HVAC system in 2018, and an energy-efficient LED lighting retrofit in 2022, which collectively enhance the building's operational efficiency and tenant appeal.\n\nThe property is governed by the municipal master plan, designated for \"industri og lager\" usage, and is predominantly utilized as a logistics facility with ancillary office spaces.

I then applied several compressions: 1) WAULT > 10 years with a creditworthy tenant is a significant 'bond-like' de-risking factor, justifying a -40 bps adjustment. 2) The building's modern standard (2010) and recent technical upgrades (HVAC 2015, LED 2018, Lobby 2021) warrant a -20 bps adjustment, despite the Energy C rating being standard rather than 'Prime'. 3) The presence of a tech startup adds a minor risk premium, but this is offset by the 'professional services' anchor and the overall scarcity of high-quality long-term assets in this submarket.

Positive factors include the strategic location near E18 and recent technical upgrades (HVAC, LED, Roof), which mitigate some age-related risks of the 1980 structure. However, significant yield expansion is required due to: 1) Tenant Risk: The profile consists of SMEs, which carry higher credit risk and concentration risk compared to institutional tenants (+30 bps). 2) Lease Risk: The presence of short-term lease agreements and undisclosed vacancy suggests a WAULT likely below the market norm, increasing re-letting and capex risk (+40 bps). 3) Building Age/Standard: Despite upgrades, a 1980s concrete building lacks modern ceiling heights (6m is low for modern logistics) and BREEAM certification, leading to functional obsolescence risk (+25 bps). The lack of rail connection and secondary industrial location further prevents prime pricing.
