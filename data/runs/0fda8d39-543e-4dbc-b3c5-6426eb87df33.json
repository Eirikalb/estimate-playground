This location is characterized by a mix of regional distribution centers and smaller industrial estates, providing a supportive environment for logistics and warehousing operations. The proximity to local industrial estates and smaller terminals contributes to the area’s focus on supporting smaller tenants, while the limited visibility and access from main transport routes create a suboptimal micro-location for larger corporate logistics operations. \n\nThe building itself, constructed in 1980, is a single-story warehouse facility with a total gross building area (BTA) of approximately 6,200 m². The structure features a traditional steel frame construction with composite metal cladding, designed to withstand heavy industrial use. The site is registered under the cadastral designation gnr. 123, bnr. 45 in Skedsmo municipality, encompassing a total land area of 10,000 m², allowing for ample parking and loading areas necessary for the intended logistics functions.\n\nAccessibility is primarily via road, with direct connections to the E6 and E18 highways facilitating transportation to regional and national markets. However, the property benefits from limited rail connections, which could restrict certain logistics functionalities and affect potential tenant interest. The surrounding area includes various infrastructure support, such as gas stations and service facilities, which cater to the logistics sector but lack the robust public transport options found in central urban settings.\n\nThe building currently houses a government tenant, which enhances the security of cash flows associated with the property. While the presence of a AAA-rated corporate tenant is a positive aspect, the overall tenant base is smaller, emphasizing the need for potential renovations to attract additional, high-caliber tenants in the competitive logistics market. The asset is characterized by a functional layout, with a clear span warehouse design and multiple loading docks, although it would require substantial refurbishment to meet modern standards and improve overall operational efficiency.\n\nOver the years, the property has undergone several technical upgrades to maintain its functionality. Notable improvements include the installation of a new HVAC system in 2015, enhancements to loading dock facilities in 2018, and a complete roof refurbishment in 2020. Despite these upgrades, the building still requires additional renovations, particularly in the areas of insulation and energy efficiency, to align with current regulatory requirements and tenant expectations. As of the latest evaluation, the building retains an energy rating of D, which indicates room for improvement in sustainability metrics.\n\nThe property is regulated under the municipal master plan designated for \"industriområde,\" affirming its intended use as a warehouse and logistics facility. Its primary usage is currently as a distribution center with ancillary office space, which constitutes approximately 10% of the total area. The tenancy structure reflects the skew towards governmental tenants, but as the market evolves, there is significant potential for tenant diversification through strategic marketing and property upgrades.\n\nIn summary, while Lagerveien 12 presents unique challenges due to its suboptimal micro-location and the need for further investment in renovations, the presence of a government tenant provides a stable income foundation. This property offers an opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on the growing demand for logistics solutions in the region, albeit with a critical eye on the necessary enhancements to maximize its potential and appeal to a broader tenant audience.",

The surrounding context is characterized by local industrial estates, smaller logistics terminals, and distribution centers, which together form an established yet secondary logistics hub. This micro-location presents specific challenges, notably suboptimal access and visibility, which could impact the property’s attractiveness to potential tenants. Despite these limitations, the area retains a functional industrial character that has supported various smaller tenant operations.\n\nThe building, constructed in 1978, is a single-story logistics facility comprising a gross building area of approximately 3,500 m² BTA. It features a traditional steel frame construction with a concrete floor, designed to accommodate warehousing and light manufacturing activities. The property is situated on a plot of 10,000 m², with cadastral references gnr. 56, bnr. 29 in Moss municipality. The expansive outdoor area includes loading docks and ample parking space, essential for logistics operations. The property’s design allows for flexible internal configurations, with clear heights of approximately 6 meters, facilitating the storage of various goods.\n\nPublic transport connections are limited, with the nearest bus stop located approximately 1 kilometer from the property along Terminalveien, while the closest railway station is about 3 kilometers away, which may reduce its appeal for logistics companies that prefer direct rail access for freight transport. Nevertheless, the property benefits from excellent road connectivity via the E6 motorway, providing direct links to Oslo and other major urban centers.\n\nThe building has undergone several technical upgrades over the years to enhance its functionality and energy efficiency. Notable improvements include the installation of a new HVAC system in 2015, a roof refurbishment in 2018, and an energy-efficient LED lighting upgrade in 2020, contributing to a better operational environment for tenants. Despite these improvements, the property has specific renovation requirements to modernize its facilities and improve overall aesthetic appeal, which presents an opportunity for value-added investment.\n\nCurrently, the property is utilized predominantly for warehouse and distribution purposes, accommodating a small tenant base consisting mainly of local businesses involved in retail and distribution. The tenancy structure highlights a relatively high vacancy rate, which can be attributed to the aforementioned suboptimal micro-location and the need for renovations, impacting the overall market yield. The flexible floor space allows for potential reconfiguration to attract new tenants, enhancing the viability of the property in the competitive logistics market.\n\nZoning regulations indicate that the property is classified for industrial use, aligning with its current operational profile and allowing for various logistics-related activities. However, the local master plan does not foresee significant changes, which may limit future development options. The combination of older building stock and the surrounding smaller tenant base underscores the necessity for strategic repositioning of the asset to better meet contemporary logistics demands.\n\nAlthough the property is not certified under any environmental schemes such as BREEAM or LEED, the recent upgrades indicate a commitment to improving energy sustainability, though further investment may be required to achieve more substantial environmental performance metrics. The opportunity for enhancement through renovation and modernization presents a strategic avenue for potential investors looking to capitalize on the evolving logistics landscape in the region. Overall, while the property possesses certain limitations tied to its location and condition, it also offers significant upside potential, making it an intriguing investment proposition for discerning buyers.",

Adjacent landmarks include the newly developed Alnabru terminal complex and proximity to the Oslo Airport Gardermoen, both of which solidify the location's reputation as a prime logistics hub.\n\nThe building is a modern warehouse facility constructed in 2018, offering high-standard specifications tailored for contemporary logistics operations. It comprises a single-storey structure with a gross building area of approximately 9,500 m² BTA. The building features a steel frame construction with precast concrete walls and insulated roofing, designed to meet the latest safety and sustainability standards, reflecting an exceptional micro-location within the highly sought-after Alnabru area. The property sits on a plot of 15,000 m², with cadastral designation gnr. 188, bnr. 22 in Oslo municipality, allowing for ample space for vehicle maneuvering and loading/unloading operations.\n\nThe warehouse benefits from significant technical upgrades since its completion, including the installation of an advanced fire suppression system in 2019, energy-efficient LED lighting throughout the facility in 2020, and a state-of-the-art HVAC system in 2021.

Step 2: Position Within Range - The property is a modern office building constructed in 2010 with contemporary design and state-of-the-art amenities. However, it lacks additional environmental certifications like BREEAM or LEED, and has an energy rating of C. Given these factors, it is likely a secondary asset, suggesting a mid-to-upper range position within the benchmark. Step 3: Apply Adjustments - Tenant quality and creditworthiness: The single-tenant occupancy introduces concentration risk, which pushes the yield up. Lease length and WAULT: Not specified, but single-tenant occupancy generally implies a longer lease, which could stabilize income and push yield down. Building age and condition: The building is relatively new and well-maintained, pushing the yield down. Special factors: The strategic location in a vibrant district with good transport links is a positive factor, pushing the yield down. Considering these factors, the yield is adjusted slightly upwards from the midpoint of the range due to tenant concentration risk. Step 4: Calculate Final Yield - Starting from a midpoint of 6.25% within the range, adjustments for tenant concentration risk push the yield slightly higher, but location and building condition push it back down, resulting in a final yield estimate of 6.25%.",

Therefore, it belongs to the 'Office Bergen' segment with a benchmark yield range of 5.25%–7.25%. Step 2: Position Within Range - The property is a modern office building with high-quality amenities and a strategic location, but it lacks environmental certifications and has a single SME tenant, which introduces concentration risk. This suggests it is not a prime asset but rather a secondary one, positioning it towards the middle to higher end of the range. Step 3: Apply Adjustments - Tenant quality and creditworthiness: The single SME tenant introduces concentration risk, pushing the yield up. Lease length and WAULT: Not specified, but single tenancy suggests potential risk, pushing the yield up. Building age and condition: Modern building with recent upgrades, pushing the yield down. Special factors: Lack of environmental certifications and energy rating of C, pushing the yield up.

The tenant's creditworthiness and lease length are not specified, but the single-tenant nature suggests potential volatility in income, further pushing the yield up. The building's age and condition are positive factors, but the lack of environmental certifications and the energy rating of C are neutral to slightly negative factors.
