Situated approximately 150 meters from the bustling Stortorvet square and the iconic Oslo Cathedral, this prime office location benefits from its proximity to numerous cultural landmarks, including the Parliament building and the Opera House. The property enjoys excellent transport connectivity, with Oslo Central Station just a five-minute walk away, providing access to all major rail lines, as well as the Jernbanetorget metro hub offering multiple metro and tram lines. This ensures seamless travel options for tenants and clients alike, reinforcing the property’s appeal within Oslo's commercial real estate market.\n\nConstructed in 1982, the building is a well-maintained, six-story office property with a gross building area of approximately 3,250 m² BTA. The structure features a modern glass façade, reflecting contemporary design principles, and offers open-plan office areas with flexible layouts that cater to various tenant needs. The cadastral designation is gnr. 211, bnr. 9 in Oslo municipality, and the property is situated on a plot of 890 m². The building’s construction primarily utilizes reinforced concrete with energy-efficient glazing, ensuring ample natural light throughout the workspaces.\n\nIn terms of technical enhancements, the property has undergone significant upgrades in recent years aimed at improving both functionality and sustainability. Notable renovations include the installation of a new heating and ventilation system in 2019, the modernization of elevator systems in 2020, and a comprehensive refurbishment of shared facilities, including restrooms and kitchen areas, completed in 2021. An energy audit carried out in 2022 reflected improvements in energy efficiency, demonstrating the owner’s commitment to maintaining high operational standards.\n\nThe property is regulated under the municipal master plan with the primary use classified as \"kontor\" (offices), complemented by ancillary service areas. Currently, the tenancy structure comprises a single SME tenant operating in the professional services sector, which poses a concentration risk due to the absence of diversification in tenant profiles. This tenant, however, is a recognized government contractor with a strong credit rating, mitigating some concerns associated with the concentration risk. The lease for this tenant is relatively short, with less than three years remaining, necessitating proactive lease management strategies to maximize future occupancy rates and rental yields.\n\nThe immediate area surrounding Grensen 18 is characterized by a vibrant mix of retail, dining, and cultural institutions, with pedestrian-friendly streets attracting both locals and tourists. The proximity to the Oslo Stock Exchange further elevates the property’s status within the financial and business community, making it an attractive option for potential future tenants seeking a central business address.\n\nIn summary, Grensen 18 presents a unique opportunity for investors seeking a strategically located office building in Oslo’s historic center. Despite the current concentration risk associated with a single SME tenant and a short remaining lease, the strong credit profile of the tenant, coupled with ongoing enhancements to the property, positions it as a compelling asset within a dynamic and evolving commercial real estate market.",

The surrounding area is characterized by a mix of older industrial estates and smaller logistics operations, contributing to the regional distribution capabilities of the municipality. Directly adjacent to the property is a well-established industrial park, supplemented by smaller freight terminals, enhancing the attractiveness of this location for logistics-oriented businesses. Although the property benefits from reasonable road connectivity, including quick access to the E6 motorway, its suboptimal micro-location poses challenges in terms of visibility and access, which may affect potential tenant interest and operational efficiency.\n\nThe building was constructed in 1980 and features a single-story design with a gross building area of approximately 3,200 m² BTA. The structure employs precast concrete and traditional steel construction techniques, providing durability and adaptability for various logistics and warehousing functions. The cadastral designation is gnr. 302, bnr. 18 in Lillestrøm municipality, with an owned plot of 5,000 m².\n\nInternally, the space is organized to accommodate flexible warehousing with a clear height of 5 meters, suitable for storage and distribution activities. The property is equipped with loading docks and a small office area, which occupies approximately 200 m² of the total footprint.

Notable landmarks include the Lillestrøm logistics park and the nearby trade center, enhancing the area's commercial viability. While public transport options are limited, there are bus services available to the nearby Lillestrøm train station, which connects to regional and national rail services, albeit with infrequent schedules.\n\nThe property is governed by the municipal master plan, which designates it for “bebyggelse og anlegg” with a focus on logistics and light industrial use. The tenancy structure is dominated by a single AAA-rated corporate tenant, which has been leasing the property since 2015, ensuring stable income and minimizing vacancy risks. The corporate tenant is engaged in international distribution, leveraging the property's logistics capabilities for their operations. This long-term lease with a significant tenant contributes positively to the property’s income profile, though the location's inherent challenges—such as limited visibility and access—may constrain potential rent growth and overall market appeal.\n\nSustainability aspects of the property are currently limited to the aforementioned energy-efficient upgrades and basic compliance with historical building codes. The property does not possess additional environmental certifications such as BREEAM or LEED, which may further influence its attractiveness for prospective tenants who prioritize sustainability.\n\nIn summary, Lagerveien 12 presents a unique opportunity within a secondary logistics market, characterized by its practical layout and long-term lease with a government or AAA-rated corporate tenant, despite its suboptimal micro-location and the challenges associated with older building stock. Prospective investors should consider these factors within the broader context of the regional logistics landscape and the evolving demands of the commercial real estate market.",

Notably, the property lies within a region characterized by a mixed industrial landscape that supports various light manufacturing and logistics operations. However, the micro-location is deemed suboptimal due to limited visibility and poor access routes, which may influence operational efficiency and tenant attraction.\n\nThe building was originally constructed in 1982 and is designed as a single-story logistics facility, featuring a gross building area of approximately 3,500 m² BTA. The structure employs pre-cast concrete walls and a metal roof, tailored for industrial use with ample loading access. The cadastral designation for the property is gnr. 302, bnr. 17 in Drammen municipality, situated on a plot measuring approximately 10,000 m².

While these improvements have extended the building’s operational lifespan, the need for further renovations is evident to enhance energy efficiency and operational functionality, particularly in light of evolving tenant requirements.\n\nThe property is currently utilized predominantly for logistics and storage purposes, with a tenant composition that includes local distribution firms and smaller logistics operators. The tenancy structure is characterized by short to medium-term leases, reflecting the flexible nature of the secondary logistics market.
