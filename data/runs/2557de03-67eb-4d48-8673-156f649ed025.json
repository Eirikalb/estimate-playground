The office areas on each floor range from approximately 350 m² to 550 m², providing flexible layouts to accommodate various tenant needs.

This location is characterized by an eclectic mix of office spaces, retail outlets, and cultural establishments, making it a desirable location for businesses looking to capitalize on the foot traffic from both tourists and locals. The proximity to NTNU university fosters a dynamic environment conducive to innovation and collaboration, with key institutions such as SINTEF enhancing the area's reputation as a hub for research and technology.\n\nAccess to public transportation is excellent, with Trondheim S station just a 10-minute walk away, providing seamless connections to regional and national rail services. Additionally, the comprehensive tram and bus network serves the area, ensuring easy commutes for employees and clients alike. Værnes Airport is also reachable via a short train ride, further emphasizing the strategic connectivity of the location.\n\nThe property comprises a modern office building originally constructed in 1992, featuring a contemporary architectural style that integrates well with the surrounding urban fabric. The building encompasses five floors, with a total gross building area of approximately 3,125 m² BTA, and occupies a plot of 800 m², registered under cadastral designation gnr. 305, bnr. 12 in Trondheim municipality. The structure features reinforced concrete construction with expansive glass facades, allowing for abundant natural light within the workspace, enhancing the overall tenant experience.\n\nOver the past five years, the property has undergone significant upgrades aimed at modernizing the facilities and enhancing energy efficiency. Notable improvements include a comprehensive refurbishment of the HVAC system in 2019, installation of energy-efficient LED lighting in 2020, and renovation of common areas, including the lobby and restroom facilities, in 2021. These upgrades have contributed to a more sustainable and attractive workplace, although the building currently holds an energy rating of D (moderate), indicating further potential for enhancement.\n\nThe property is primarily utilized as office space, with supplementary areas designated for meeting rooms and shared facilities. The tenancy structure indicates a diverse mix of tenants engaged in professional services, technology, and creative industries. However, it is important to note that the majority of existing leases are short-term, with less than three years remaining on the current agreements. This aspect introduces a level of uncertainty regarding future income stability and tenant retention, which prospective buyers should carefully consider.\n\nThe municipal master plan designates the property for \"bebyggelse og anlegg (fremtidig),\" reflecting its ongoing use as a commercial office building. The layout of the floors allows for flexible space utilization, with typical floor plates ranging from approximately 550 m² to 600 m², accommodating both large and smaller office configurations. While the building currently maintains a healthy occupancy rate, the presence of short leases signals an opportunity for potential repositioning or redevelopment, should the new owner choose to pursue such strategies.\n\nIn conclusion, Munkegata 21 presents a compelling opportunity for investors seeking a strategically located commercial property in Trondheim's Midtbyen district. While the existing short-term leases may influence immediate yield, the prime location, recent enhancements, and inherent flexibility of the space position this asset favorably for future value appreciation in a growing university and technology-driven market.",

In 2021, the common areas were refurbished to enhance aesthetic appeal and functionality, providing tenants with a welcoming environment.\n\nThe property's current tenants comprise a single small and medium-sized enterprise (SME), which presents a concentration risk for potential investors. This single-tenant occupancy enhances the risk profile, as the financial performance of the property is significantly tied to the success of this one tenant. Despite this risk, the location's low-cost profile, combined with the building's modern amenities and sustainability credentials, positions it as a desirable offering within the Oslo South office market.\n\nSurrounding characteristics include a blend of residential neighborhoods and commercial areas, emphasizing the practical nature of the location for businesses seeking lower operating costs compared to the more central districts of Oslo.

          "reasoning": "The property is located in Ryen, which falls under the 'Office Oslo South' benchmark (6.25%–7.50%). It is positioned slightly above the midpoint of this range due to a balance of strengths and risks. Positive factors include its proximity to Ryen T-bane (400m), recent technical upgrades (ventilation, elevator, common areas), and a solid energy rating (C). However, the yield is pushed higher because of significant 'concentration risk' as a single-tenant SME property, the age of the building (1990), and the lack of high-level green certifications (BREEAM/LEED) which are increasingly required for prime pricing. A yield of 6.85% reflects its status as a well-maintained but secondary-market suburban office asset.",
