This location benefits from convenient road access to the E6 motorway, facilitating efficient regional distribution, although the area has limited rail connections. The immediate surroundings are predominantly industrial, featuring a mix of older warehouses and newer logistics facilities, which contribute to the area's overall functionality as a distribution hub. The cadastral designation for this property is gnr. 205, bnr. 14 in Sørum municipality, encompassing an owned plot of 12,300 m².\n\nConstructed in 1998, the building comprises a single-story logistics facility encompassing approximately 6,500 m² BTA. The property features a functional layout optimized for logistics operations, with a clear height of 6 meters and multiple loading docks designed to accommodate various freight vehicles. The building's structure is primarily reinforced concrete, which provides durability and flexibility for various tenant needs. However, the facility shows signs of aging, and significant capital expenditures (capex) are anticipated to modernize the property to meet contemporary logistics standards.\n\nThe tenancy structure currently includes three diverse tenants, ensuring a stable income stream despite an aging building stock. Each tenant operates within the logistics and distribution sectors, capitalizing on the property’s strategic location. The diversified tenant base reflects a healthy demand for space in this secondary logistics area, which is crucial for mitigating vacancy risks and enhancing rental income potential.\n\nRecent technical upgrades to the facility include the installation of new loading dock equipment in 2020, enhancing operational efficiency, and a comprehensive roof refurbishment completed in 2023, which addressed insulation and water tightness issues. However, the rest of the building requires modernization, and the need for additional capex is highlighted by the lack of energy-efficient systems and updated facilities. Currently, the building holds an energy rating of C, indicating room for improvement in sustainability performance.\n\nThe property benefits from a variety of transport connections, including proximity to key arterial roads that facilitate regional logistics operations. Local bus services are available, although rail access is limited in this area, which is not uncommon for secondary logistics locations. Nearby landmarks include the Sørum industrial park and various smaller distribution centers, further solidifying the property's role as a logistical nexus.\n\nThe primary regulatory framework for the property allows for continued use as a logistics facility, with designated areas for storage and distribution cited in the municipal master plan. Future regulatory shifts or infrastructure developments may enhance the appeal of the location, providing an opportunity for growth in rental income and property value.\n\nIn summary, while the property at Lagerveien 42 presents significant opportunities due to its diversified tenant base and strategic location within a secondary logistics area, it is essential to recognize the implications of its older building stock, which necessitates substantial renovation efforts to unlock its full potential. The combination of a well-located property, an established tenant base, and the possibility for modernization could make this an attractive investment for parties interested in the logistics sector.",

          "reasoning": "Step 1: Identify Base Benchmark\nThis property is a secondary logistics facility located in Sørum, a secondary logistics area with older building stock (constructed 1998) and functional but not prime characteristics. This clearly falls within the 'Logistics Normal & Secondary' segment with a benchmark yield range of 6.50%–9.50%. Given the property has some positive attributes (diversified tenants, strategic location with E6 access) but also significant weaknesses (aging building, substantial capex needs), I select 7.75% as the starting point, slightly below the midpoint to reflect the functional location.\n\nStep 2: Identify All Adjustment Factors\n- Building condition and capex needs: The 1998 construction, energy rating C, and explicit need for significant modernization beyond recent roof/dock upgrades = UP\n- Tenant diversification: Three tenants providing income diversification = DOWN\n- Location quality: Secondary logistics area with good E6 access but limited rail connections, mixed industrial surroundings = NEUTRAL to slight UP\n- Building specifications: 6-meter clear height is below modern logistics standards (typically 8-10m+), limiting tenant appeal = UP\n- Size: 6,500 m² is relatively small for logistics, limiting institutional appeal = UP\n- Recent technical upgrades: New loading docks (2020) and roof refurbishment (2023) partially mitigate condition concerns = DOWN\n\nStep 3: Calculate with Explicit Arithmetic\nBase (Logistics Normal & Secondary, lower-middle range): 7.75%\n+ Building age and capex requirements: +0.50%\n- Tenant diversification (3 tenants): -0.25%\n+ Below-standard clear height and smaller size: +0.35%\n+ Secondary location characteristics: +0.15%\n- Recent technical upgrades mitigating some risks: -0.20%\n= Final: 8.30%\n\nStep 4: Validation Check\nThe final yield of 8.30% sits comfortably within the 6.50%–9.50% range for Logistics Normal & Secondary. This reflects a property with moderate-to-higher risk due to aging infrastructure and required capex, partially offset by tenant diversification and functional location. The yield appropriately positions this asset in the upper-middle portion of the secondary logistics range, accounting for all material risk factors including building obsolescence, size limitations, and modernization needs.\n\nStep 5: The market yield for this secondary logistics property is 8.30%.",

          "reasoning": "Step 1: Identify Base Benchmark\nThis property is an office building located in Økern, Oslo, which is an emerging office district in eastern Oslo. Based on the location characteristics (eastern Oslo, outside traditional CBD/Centre areas, but still within Oslo proper with good transport links), this best fits the 'Office Oslo East' segment with a benchmark yield range of 5.75%–7.25%. Given the property's characteristics, I'll start at the midpoint: 6.50%.\n\nStep 2: Identify All Adjustment Factors\n\nPositive factors (yield compression/DOWN):\n- Tenant quality & lease length: Long-term lease with creditworthy tenant, WAULT >10 years provides exceptional income stability = DOWN\n- Recent technical upgrades: Façade renovation (2020), HVAC upgrades (2021), common area refurbishment (2022) = DOWN\n- Location improvements: Proximity to Helsfyr metro (600m), emerging district with ongoing infrastructure development = DOWN\n- Transport accessibility: Good public transport and Ring 3 road access = DOWN\n\nNegative factors (yield expansion/UP):\n- Building age: Constructed 1997, classified as older asset (pre-2000) = UP\n- Future capex requirements: Anticipated modernization needed for energy efficiency despite recent upgrades = UP\n- Single tenant concentration: Heavily weighted towards one tenant creates re-letting risk despite creditworthiness = UP\n- Secondary location: Økern is emerging but not prime Oslo office location (not CBD, Centre, Skøyen, or Lysaker) = already reflected in base\n\nStep 3: Calculate with Explicit Arithmetic\n\nBase (Office Oslo East midpoint): 6.50%\n- Long WAULT (>10yr) with creditworthy tenant: -0.40%\n- Recent technical upgrades (façade, HVAC, common areas): -0.25%\n- Good transport links and emerging location: -0.15%\n+ Building age (1997, pre-2000): +0.30%\n+ Anticipated future capex needs: +0.25%\n+ Single tenant concentration risk: +0.20%\n= Final: 6.45%\n\nStep 4: Validation Check\nThe final yield of 6.45% sits within the Office Oslo East range (5.75%–7.25%) and slightly below midpoint, which is appropriate given the strong mitigating factor of long-term lease security with a creditworthy tenant offsetting the building age and capex concerns. The yield appropriately reflects a stabilized secondary Oslo office asset with excellent income visibility but some physical obsolescence risk.\n\nStep 5: The market yield estimate is 6.45%",

This property has characteristics that elevate it above typical East Oslo offices due to the income security. The yield is reasonable - better than standard East Oslo due to lease quality, but not as low as Centre/Skøyen due to location.

The modern condition and energy efficiency support a lower yield, but the suburban location prevents this from achieving inner-city yields.
