The building is situated approximately 300 metres from both St. Hanshaugen Park and the bustling Bislett district, which features a mix of cafes, restaurants, and retail outlets. The immediate vicinity combines residential charm with essential services, making it an attractive subset of Oslo's residential districts. Transport accessibility is robust; the area is serviced by the Majorstuen metro station within a 10-minute walk, as well as multiple tram lines along Bislett and convenient cycling infrastructure, facilitating smooth connectivity throughout the city.\n\nThe property comprises a five-storey mixed-use building originally constructed in 1975, characterized by traditional Norwegian architectural elements, including brick façades and large window openings that enhance natural light. The total gross building area is approximately 2,450 m² BTA, as per the sales presentation, with a built-up area of 545 m². The building features solid concrete construction and a flat roof, which has been maintained in good condition. Recent improvements include the installation of new energy-efficient windows in 2020, refurbishment of the stairwells and common areas in 2021, and a new façade treatment completed in 2022, which has improved the building’s aesthetic appeal and energy performance.\n\nThe cadastral designation for the property is gnr. 213, bnr. 24 in Oslo municipality, encompassing a plot size of approximately 1,000 m². The property is fully utilized as a mixed-use building, accommodating both residential units and commercial office spaces on the lower floors. However, it is critical to note that the commercial spaces are leased to a government tenant with a strong credit rating, ensuring a reliable income stream despite the property's suboptimal micro-location, which is characterized by limited visibility and access from the main thoroughfares.\n\nThe tenancy structure comprises a mix of residential units and commercial office space. The commercial lease is currently short-term, with less than three years remaining, presenting potential challenges for long-term yield realization. The residential component features a combination of one- and two-bedroom apartments, which enjoy high rental demand due to their proximity to schools and daily services. The commercial tenants are primarily engaged in professional services, with the government agency occupying the largest office space on the ground floor.\n\nAlthough the property benefits from a stable government tenant, the suboptimal micro-location poses a challenge for attracting additional commercial tenants, as visibility and foot traffic are limited compared to surrounding areas. This factor, coupled with the short lease duration, necessitates a proactive leasing strategy to maximize the property’s long-term potential.\n\nThe building's zoning allows for mixed-use development, with opportunities for future enhancements or alterations, which could further increase its value. However, the current lack of environmental certifications or specific sustainability initiatives beyond general maintenance will need to be addressed to meet evolving market expectations.\n\nIn summary, Skogsveien 12 offers a unique opportunity in the bustling St. Hanshaugen area, characterized by its reliable government tenant and strong rental demand for residential units. However, prospective buyers should consider the implications of the property’s suboptimal micro-location and the short-term lease on the commercial spaces as they evaluate the potential for future growth and returns.",

      "contextDescription": "## Property Information\n\n*Overview of property details, ownership, and certifications*\n\nThe property is located at Hotellplassen 12, in the vibrant conference district of Stord, Norheimsund. Nestled between the bustling business parks and prominent conference centers, the building enjoys a strategic position approximately 500 meters from the local conference facilities and within close proximity to regional transport links. The area's character is strongly influenced by its focus on business and conference activities, supported by seasonal tourism and a growing demand for corporate accommodations. The local infrastructure includes convenient access to the E134 highway, facilitating travel to major urban centers, while the nearest bus stop is just 200 meters away, enhancing accessibility for guests. Additionally, the property offers ample parking availability, catering to both visitors and staff.\n\nThe building, originally constructed in 1990, comprises six floors with a total gross building area of approximately 3,250 m² BTA. The structure is a modern hotel property characterized by a contemporary architectural design with large glass facades that allow for stunning views of the nearby fjord. The cadastral designation is gnr. 189, bnr. 42 in Kvam municipality, with an owned plot of 2,500 m². The hotel layout features an efficient floor plan with an average room size of 25 m², combining both guest rooms and conference facilities on dedicated floors.\n\nWhile the property is primarily occupied by a single SME tenant, which introduces a degree of concentration risk, the hotel's operational performance has been bolstered by the tenant's commitment to providing quality service. This tenant has also established a reputation for reliability, further emphasized by their multiple industry awards for excellence in hospitality and customer satisfaction. However, the property does face challenges due to its suboptimal micro-location, characterized by limited visibility from major thoroughfares and less-than-ideal access routes, which could impact potential future occupancy rates and market appeal.\n\nThe building has undergone several notable technical upgrades over the past few years, enhancing both functionality and guest experience. Key improvements include the installation of energy-efficient heating and cooling systems in 2015, a comprehensive refurbishment of guest rooms in 2018, and a complete renovation of the lobby and common areas in 2021. These upgrades have significantly improved the property’s aesthetic appeal and operational efficiency; however, supplementary details regarding the building's energy rating and compliance with sustainability initiatives are not available in the context.\n\nThe property is situated in a region with a strong focus on business tourism, benefiting from its proximity to key landmarks such as the Stord Conference Center and the Norheimsund Business Park. This location fosters a steady flow of corporate clients, particularly during peak conference seasons, although the dependency on corporate rates may introduce a level of volatility in revenue generation. The building's immediate environment is primarily commercial, filled with ancillary services and amenities that cater to both business guests and leisure travelers.\n\nIn summary, while Hotellplassen 12 offers a premium opportunity within the conference district of Stord, prospective investors should carefully consider the implications of the single tenant structure and the property's micro-location challenges when evaluating its long-term yield potential. The building's award-winning management and excellent fjord views provide significant value, but the current reliance on a single tenant presents an inherent risk that must be accounted for in any investment analysis.",

Parking is readily available on-site, enhancing accessibility for both business travelers and local clientele. The surrounding environment is characterized by a mix of conference centers, business parks, and residential developments, making it an ideal hub for corporate activities and regional tourism.\n\nConstructed in 2010, the property is a modern hotel development featuring a contemporary architectural design that incorporates large glass facades, providing guests with stunning views of the adjacent fjord.

The property manager’s strong reputation in the hospitality sector adds a layer of confidence regarding operational efficiency and tenant satisfaction.\n\nPublic transport accessibility is robust, with regular bus services connecting to key destinations in Sandnes and nearby Stavanger.

Key enhancements include the installation of energy-efficient heating and cooling systems in 2018, a comprehensive refurbishment of guest rooms and public areas in 2020, and the addition of a solar panel array in 2021, which further improves the building's sustainability profile. These initiatives have resulted in an energy rating of B (green), a testament to the property’s commitment to environmentally responsible operations.\n\nThe property is regulated under the municipal master plan as a hotel facility, allowing for continued hospitality use or potential conversion into alternative commercial uses if desired. The immediate vicinity features a mix of office developments, retail spaces, and leisure amenities that cater to both business and leisure guests, reinforcing the property's market positioning as a preferred destination for corporate events and accommodation.\n\nIn summary, Parkveien 45 presents a compelling investment opportunity within a thriving regional market characterized by a strong business and conference focus. While the single SME tenant introduces a concentration risk, the property’s modern facilities, strategic location, and experienced management team contribute to a resilient asset profile with the potential for long-term value enhancement.",
