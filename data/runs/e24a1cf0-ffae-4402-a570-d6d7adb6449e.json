Additionally, the site is conveniently situated near a rail freight terminal and is approximately 30 kilometers from Oslo Airport Gardermoen, solidifying its status as a vital last-mile distribution hub. The surrounding area is characterized by modern warehouse facilities, serving an array of logistics tenants and essential distribution operations.\n\nThe subject property occupies a plot of 12,500 m², registered with the municipal cadastral designation gnr. 123, bnr. 56 in Vestby municipality. Constructed in 2015, the building spans a single level with a gross building area of approximately 8,200 m² BTA. The structure features a modern concrete frame with high-performance insulation, designed to meet contemporary warehouse specifications. The property benefits from a clear height of 10 meters and is equipped with multiple loading docks, facilitating efficient goods handling and storage. The design incorporates energy-efficient lighting and climate control systems, contributing to reduced operational costs and improved sustainability.\n\nThis facility is currently occupied by a single small to medium-sized enterprise (SME) tenant, presenting a concentration risk; however, this tenant's established reputation in the logistics sector enhances the property's attractiveness. The immediate vicinity includes several major logistics terminals and distribution hubs, further underlining the competitive demand for quality warehousing solutions in the area. The property’s exceptional micro-location within Vestby distinguishes it from other offerings, providing unparalleled access to key transportation routes and logistical infrastructure.\n\nThe logistics center has undergone various technical upgrades since its construction, with significant enhancements including the installation of energy-efficient LED lighting throughout the premises in 2019, a state-of-the-art fire safety system added in 2020, and the installation of an advanced climate control system in 2021. These upgrades not only improve operational efficiency but also contribute to a reduced environmental footprint, aligning with modern sustainability standards.\n\nThe property is designated for industrial use under the municipal master plan, with the primary purpose being \"bebyggelse og anlegg\" (building and construction). It is utilized predominantly as a logistics and distribution center, catering to the needs of its SME tenant while also allowing flexibility for future expansion or reconfiguration should tenant requirements change. The facility offers ample space for both storage and operational functions, with a well-structured layout conducive to efficient logistical flows.\n\nTransport connectivity is robust, supported by established road networks and proximity to essential logistics services, ensuring seamless operations for the current tenant and future occupants. The area is experiencing considerable growth in demand for logistics solutions, driven by the rise of e-commerce and the necessity for rapid delivery services, making this property a compelling investment opportunity.\n\nIn summary, Lagerveien 12 presents a well-constructed, modern logistics facility in a prime location, characterized by strong transport links and a competitive micro-location within Vestby. The concentration of a single SME tenant does introduce a level of risk; however, the facility's operational specifications and improvement history, combined with the ongoing demand for logistics properties in the region, reinforce its potential as a solid investment in the commercial real estate market.",
