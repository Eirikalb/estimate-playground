The cadastral designation is gnr. 36, bnr. 45 in Ålesund municipality, and the property sits on a plot of 1,500 m², providing substantial outdoor space for customer parking as well as potential expansions.\n\nA key aspect of this property is its long-term lease agreement with a creditworthy tenant, currently extending beyond a 10-year Weighted Average Unexpired Lease Term (WAULT), ensuring a stable income stream. However, it is important to note that the retail market in the vicinity is currently experiencing an imminent vacancy, with over 20% of the space left unoccupied, posing some risks related to tenant dependency on anchor retailers in the area. \n\nThe building's management is entrusted to a highly reputable property manager, recognized with several industry awards for excellence in service and operational efficiency, which enhances the property’s appeal to potential investors. Enhancements made to the property include a comprehensive refurbishment of the façade in 2021, the installation of energy-efficient LED lighting systems in 2022, and the upgrading of HVAC systems in 2023, which collectively contribute to a modern and efficient retail environment.\n\nTransport connectivity remains robust, with multiple bus routes servicing Sjøgata and surrounding areas, while the proximity to major road networks facilitates access from surrounding suburbs and out-of-town centers. This accessibility, combined with the strategic location near other retail giants, ensures that foot traffic remains steady, allowing for potential recovery of currently vacant spaces.\n\nIn summary, this property at Sjøgata 45 presents a unique investment opportunity in the Ålesund retail market, characterized by its modern construction, a long lease with a creditworthy tenant, and a strong award-winning property management team. The imminent vacancy presents both a challenge and an opportunity for astute investors looking to capitalize on the property’s potential, particularly in light of its strategic location and the established presence of nearby retail anchors.",
