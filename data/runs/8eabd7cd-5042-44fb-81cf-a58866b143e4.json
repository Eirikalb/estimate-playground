Government tenant and long lease = very low risk. Modern building with certification. Position at low end of range, slight compression for quality.\nResult: {\"yield\": 4.50, \"reasoning\": \"Prime CBD, government tenant, long lease, modern certified building - bond-like characteristics justify lowest yields\"}\n\n**Example 2:**\nProperty: Office building in Oslo Lysaker, built 2005, single tenant (mid-sized IT company), 4 years remaining on lease.\nAnalysis: Lysaker range is 5.50-7.00%. Single corporate tenant with medium lease. Building is 20 years old. Position mid-range, slight expansion for tenant and building factors.\nResult: {\"yield\": 6.50, \"reasoning\": \"Lysaker mid-range positioning, single tenant adds concentration risk, older building needs consideration, medium lease term\"}\n\n**Example 3:**\nProperty: Logistics warehouse outside Bergen, built 1995, three tenants (logistics companies), average 6 years remaining.\nAnalysis: Logistics Normal range 6.50-9.50%. Diversified tenants good. Old building is concern. Medium lease. Secondary location.\nResult: {\"yield\": 7.75, \"reasoning\": \"Secondary logistics location, older building requiring capex, partially offset by diversified tenant base and reasonable lease terms\"}\n\n---\n\nNow evaluate this property:\n\n{{scenario.contextDescription}}\n\nReturn JSON only: {\"yield\": <number>, \"reasoning\": \"<your analysis following the same pattern>\"}\n\n",
