Current Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) stands at approximately $18M, with a customer base of 250 clinics, including a growing number of multi-location groups. The average contract value (ACV) is around $72K, with a typical sales cycle of six months for new customer acquisitions. The company enjoys a Net Revenue Retention (NRR) of 115%, benefiting from strong upselling through its tiered service offerings.\n\n### Team & Funding\n\nThe leadership team is comprised of CEO Jessica Lin (ex-Product Lead at a major tech firm), CTO Michael Rodriguez (former data science lead at a top healthcare analytics company), and COO Sarah Patel (ex-McKinsey consultant turned operator with a focus on operational excellence). CareFlow currently employs 98 team members, distributed across engineering (40%), sales & marketing (35%), and G&A (25%). The company has successfully raised a total of $45M in funding, with the most recent Series B round led by Sequoia Capital, achieving a $200M post-money valuation in late 2023.\n\n### Market Position & Competition\n\nCareFlow operates within the $15B healthcare management software market, which is witnessing a significant shift towards cloud-based solutions. Key competitors include AdvancedMD, PracticeSuite, and DrChrono. CareFlow differentiates itself through a user-friendly interface, integrated telehealth capabilities, and robust data analytics that empower clinics to make informed operational decisions.\n\n### Recent Developments\n\n- CareFlow has recently expanded its geographic footprint, launching services in three new states, which now account for 20% of total revenue.\n- The company has moved to a new headquarters featuring state-of-the-art amenities aimed at fostering collaboration and innovation; this relocation has already garnered attention, contributing to its recognition as one of the best places to work in the region.\n- In Q4, CareFlow launched a telehealth module, allowing clinics to offer virtual visits seamlessly, further driving customer engagement and satisfaction.\n- The company has strategically decided to exit non-core markets to focus resources on its highest-performing regions, which will increase operational efficiencies and improve growth metrics.\n\nCareFlow's proactive steps in expanding its geographic presence while refining its market focus are set to position the company favorably for sustained growth in a competitive landscape. The combination of strong leadership, a compelling product offering, and a commitment to enhancing customer experiences underscores CareFlow’s potential for future success.",
