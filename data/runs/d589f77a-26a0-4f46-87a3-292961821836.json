This prime office location enjoys excellent visibility and accessibility, being approximately 300 metres from Oslo Central Station, which serves all metro lines, national rail connections, and the airport express. The area is characterized by a vibrant mix of historical architecture, retail establishments, and cultural institutions, including the nearby Opera House and Munch Museum, creating a dynamic urban environment that attracts both foot traffic and business activity.\n\nThe building is a modern, six-storey office property constructed in 2010, featuring a contemporary design with an emphasis on natural light and efficiency. The gross building area (BTA) is approximately 2,850 m², with typical floor plates around 500 m², providing flexible office space suited for a range of professional uses. The structure is built with high-quality materials, combining steel and glass elements that contribute to an energy-efficient performance. The property is registered under the cadastral designation gnr. 220, bnr. 45 in Oslo municipality, situated on a plot of 450 m².\n\nTransport options in the vicinity are robust, with Jernbanetorget metro hub providing access to multiple metro lines, and an extensive tram network servicing the surrounding areas. The property is easily accessible by road, with Prinsens gate serving as a key thoroughfare leading into the central business district. The pedestrian-friendly environment enhances its attractiveness for both employees and visitors.\n\nThe building has been well-maintained and upgraded over the years. Notable improvements include the installation of energy-efficient HVAC systems in 2015, a comprehensive refurbishment of the building’s façade in 2018 to enhance thermal performance, and an upgrade to the internal lighting systems in 2020 to meet modern sustainability standards. The property holds an energy rating of C, reflecting its commitment to energy efficiency and sustainable practices.\n\nCurrently, the property is leased to a single SME tenant with a focus on professional services, creating a concentration risk due to the reliance on one income source. The lease, however, is backed by a government entity, ensuring a stable and reputable tenant occupying the space. The remaining lease term is under three years, presenting potential investment opportunities for future income adjustments or re-leasing strategies, though this short lease duration introduces an element of risk in terms of future occupancy.\n\nThe property is predominantly used as office space, with supplementary areas allocated for storage and meeting rooms. The tenant enjoys a productive work environment supported by modern amenities, including high-speed internet connectivity, conference facilities, and communal areas that foster collaboration and innovation. \n\nIn summary, this property represents a compelling opportunity for investors and stakeholders looking to capitalize on a well-positioned office asset within Oslo’s thriving commercial landscape. While the concentration risk associated with a single SME tenant and the short lease term may concern some, the property’s strategic location, strong tenant profile, and high-quality construction offer a solid foundation for future growth and value appreciation. As an asset in a prime urban setting, it holds significant potential for those seeking to expand their portfolio in Norway's capital.",

The site benefits from its proximity to various smaller terminals and local industrial zones, which define its operational landscape. While the area is home to several logistics and distribution firms, the micro-location presents challenges such as limited visibility from main thoroughfares and suboptimal road access, affecting overall accessibility for larger vehicles. The cadastral designation for this property is gnr. 156, bnr. 24 within the municipality of Drammen, encompassing a plot area of 1,200 m².\n\nConstructed in 1988, the building spans two floors with a total gross area of approximately 2,300 m² BTA. The property features a steel frame with a combination of concrete and metal cladding, typical of industrial construction of its era. Internal layouts consist of open-plan logistics and warehousing space on the ground floor, complemented by office areas on the second floor. The first floor provides approximately 1,400 m² of warehouse space, while the office section, totaling around 900 m², features functional workspaces with ample natural light from large windows. The property retains the original design elements, although the need for renovations has been identified to modernize the office areas and enhance operational efficiency.\n\nRecent enhancements include the installation of a new roof in 2020, which has significantly improved thermal efficiency, and the implementation of a modern heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system in 2021. Additionally, a comprehensive upgrade of the office interiors occurred in 2023, featuring new carpets, paint, and lighting systems, which have elevated the working environment. Despite these upgrades, the building's energy rating remains at E, reflecting its older structure and the need for ongoing improvements to meet contemporary sustainability standards.\n\nThe property is governed by the municipal zoning plan, allowing for \"bebyggelse og anlegg (logistikk)\" usage, primarily serving logistics and industrial functions. The current tenancy structure comprises a single occupant, a well-regarded AAA-rated corporation specializing in regional distribution, which enhances the property’s attractiveness to potential investors due to the reliability of the income stream. This tenant has been in place since 2015, underscoring stability despite the building's suboptimal micro-location.\n\nThe logistics area is supported by a network of local roads, although access to major highways is limited, posing challenges for larger freight vehicles. Public transport options are minimal, with infrequent bus services available from the nearest stop approximately 500 meters from the property. This limited transport connectivity can impact the attractiveness of the property for prospective tenants looking for prime logistics sites with robust transport links.\n\nSurrounding landmarks include industrial hubs and smaller logistics operations, which can provide a synergistic environment for distribution activities, albeit with inherent limitations in visibility and accessibility. The location is primarily characterized by older building stock, and while it serves the immediate needs of its existing tenant, future renovations will be crucial to remain competitive within the regional market.\n\nIn summary, this property at Næringsparken 27 offers a unique investment opportunity within a secondary logistics location. While it benefits from a reliable AAA-rated corporate tenant, the suboptimal micro-location poses challenges that potential investors should consider. The property’s recent upgrades and stable occupancy provide a foundation for future enhancement and value creation in a competitive logistic environment.",

However, the site's suboptimal micro-location presents challenges, including limited visibility and poor road access, which may adversely affect logistics efficiency and brand exposure for potential tenants. The property lies in close proximity to the main road E39, providing essential connectivity to larger transport routes, although direct access to rail services remains limited.\n\nThe building is a single-story logistics facility originally constructed in 1982. It features a gross building area of approximately 2,150 m² BTA, encompassing a functional layout that includes warehouse, office, and loading dock spaces. The construction is predominantly steel frame with reinforced concrete walls and a metal roof, designed for durability and efficient space utilization. The cadastral designation is gnr. 50, bnr. 4 in Hitra municipality, with an owned plot measuring 5,000 m². The site is configured to provide ample outdoor storage and loading space, critical for logistics operations.\n\nIn recent years, the property has undergone selective upgrades to enhance functionality and meet evolving tenant needs. Notable improvements include the installation of a new energy-efficient heating system in 2019, refurbishing the office area in 2020 with modern finishes, and upgrades to the loading facilities in 2021, allowing for improved operational flow. However, the overall building stock is considered older, which implies that further renovations would be necessary to attract higher-quality tenants or to achieve optimal rental value.\n\nThe property is zoned under the municipal master plan for \"industri og lager\" (industry and warehouse), with its primary usage as a logistics facility complemented by office space for administrative activities. The internal layout consists of approximately 1,700 m² dedicated to warehouse operations and 450 m² allocated for office space, featuring basic amenities. The vacancy rate is somewhat elevated, with a mix of long-term tenants and periods of unoccupied space, reflecting the challenges associated with the suboptimal micro-location—specifically the limited access and visibility that could deter potential logistics users.\n\nSurrounding landmarks include a local industrial park that hosts several small to medium-sized companies, as well as smaller terminals serving regional distribution needs. Public transport options are minimal, with an infrequent bus service operating in the vicinity, while regional road access is primarily via E39. Notably, the limited rail connections impede logistical efficiency, making it a less attractive option for certain tenants who prioritize multimodal transport solutions.\n\nIn terms of sustainability, the building does not currently possess any recognized green certifications such as BREEAM or LEED, and the energy rating is estimated at D (moderate), indicating potential for future energy efficiency upgrades if desired. The property’s technical condition, apart from the recent upgrades, requires further assessment to evaluate the necessity of additional refurbishments or retrofitting to meet modern standards.\n\nOverall, while Lagerveien 12 offers functional space suitable for logistics operations within a secondary industrial area, its suboptimal micro-location, coupled with an aging building stock, presents challenges that must be carefully navigated to enhance its appeal and yield potential in the competitive commercial property market.",

Nygårdsgaten is situated within walking distance of significant landmarks such as the UNESCO World Heritage site Bryggen, the historic Bergenhus Fortress, and the renowned Fish Market. The proximity to the Fløibanen funicular offers convenient access to scenic views and outdoor activities, while the nearby Bergen light rail (Bybanen) and Bergen station provide efficient transport links to regional destinations, as well as Flesland Airport, further enhancing the site’s connectivity.\n\nThe building is a contemporary office structure completed in 2010, noted for its modernist design and functionality.

Furthermore, the local infrastructure supports a healthy work-life balance, with numerous recreational opportunities available in the vicinity.
