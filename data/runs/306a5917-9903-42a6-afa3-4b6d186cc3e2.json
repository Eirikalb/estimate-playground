This location is approximately 300 meters from the extensive green spaces of St. Hanshaugen Park and within walking distance to the cultural attractions along Bislett and the Aker River. The area is characterized by a vibrant mix of residential, commercial, and leisure activities, with numerous cafes, boutique shops, and cultural venues contributing to its appeal. The property benefits from excellent public transport accessibility, including metro access at the St. Hanshaugen station and several tram lines running along Bislett, with dedicated cycling infrastructure enhancing the mobility options for residents and visitors alike.\n\nThe building, completed in 1972, is a modern multi-story residential structure with a total of eight floors and a gross building area of approximately 3,200 m² BTA, set on a plot of 650 m². The property's cadastral designation is gnr. 214, bnr. 29 in Oslo municipality. The structural design showcases a robust concrete frame with large window surfaces, providing ample natural light to the living spaces. The property features well-appointed residential units, predominantly comprising one and two-bedroom apartments, appealing to both long-term residents and transient tenants, thereby ensuring a consistent rental demand.\n\nRecent upgrades have been made to the property to enhance tenant comfort and operational efficiency. Key improvements include the renovation of common areas in 2021, the replacement of all windows in 2022 to enhance energy efficiency, and the installation of a new central heating system in 2023. These upgrades contribute positively to the tenant experience and align with contemporary living standards, although the building's energy rating remains at D due to its age and original construction standards.\n\nThe property is currently occupied by a government tenant with a lease set to expire in less than three years. This tenant profile, particularly in a high-demand area like St. Hanshaugen, provides a stable income stream while also presenting potential for new ownership to reposition the asset post-lease expiration. The combination of the short lease duration and the established AAA-rated corporate tenant is a critical factor influencing the property's market yield and investment profile.\n\nThe overall tenancy structure comprises a mix of residential units alongside communal facilities, including a bicycle storage room and laundry facilities, which are highly valued by residents. With a strong historical rental demand in St. Hanshaugen, characterized by its proximity to educational institutions and essential services, the property is well-positioned to attract a diverse tenant base.\n\nRegulatory aspects are in accordance with the municipal master plan, which designates the property for residential use (bebyggelse og anlegg). The building's configuration and zoning allow for potential future development or reimagining of the space once the current lease term concludes, providing an attractive opportunity for value enhancement.\n\nWhile specific environmental certifications such as BREEAM or LEED are not reported, the recent technical upgrades and ongoing maintenance indicate a commitment to quality standards and tenant satisfaction. The combination of a prime location, reliable tenant profile, and a potential for future value creation positions Skogsveien 12 as an attractive opportunity for investors seeking a residential asset in one of Oslo's most sought-after neighborhoods.",

The building is situated approximately 300 meters from the Aker River and 500 meters from the lush green spaces of the nearby Sofienberg Park, providing both recreational opportunities and scenic views. The immediate vicinity is characterized by a blend of residential units, boutique shops, cafes, and art galleries, contributing to a dynamic urban atmosphere that attracts both locals and visitors alike. Access to public transportation is readily available, with the nearest metro station, Grünerløkka, a mere 400 meters away, along with several tram lines running along the major thoroughfares of the district. The area's cycling infrastructure is robust, making it a popular choice for commuters and residents.\n\nThe property comprises a four-story residential building originally constructed in 1992, exhibiting a contemporary architectural style with a mix of brick and glass facades. The total gross building area (BTA) is approximately 1,800 m², with a built-up area of 450 m². The cadastral designation is gnr. 225, bnr. 14 in Oslo municipality, with an owned land plot measuring 600 m². The building features a range of apartment units, including one and two-bedroom configurations, catering to a diverse tenant demographic. \n\nWhile the property benefits from its vibrant surroundings, it is important to note certain challenges that may impact its market appeal. The current lease agreements are of a short duration, with less than three years remaining on the primary contracts. This short-term lease structure introduces a degree of uncertainty in terms of future rental income and may require potential investors to consider renewal strategies or tenant reconfiguration. Additionally, the property's micro-location is deemed suboptimal due to limited visibility and access; while it is nestled in a lively area, the specific positioning on Skogsveien means that foot traffic is lower compared to more commercialized streets nearby. \n\nRecent technical upgrades have been implemented to enhance the building's appeal and operational efficiency. In 2020, a new heating system was installed, significantly improving energy efficiency. Additionally, in 2021, renovations to the communal areas were undertaken, which included modernizing the entryway and lobby, as well as updating lighting throughout the common spaces. The building has maintained a reasonable energy performance rating of D, aligning with general building regulations, although there are no current certifications such as BREEAM or LEED reported in the context.\n\nThe property is regulated under the municipal master plan designated for \"bebyggelse og anlegg (fremtidig),\" primarily for residential use. The tenant mix is predominantly residential, with a significant number of units currently occupied and a few vacant units that present an opportunity for immediate rental income upon re-leasing. However, the prospective buyer should be aware of the shorter lease terms, which could necessitate active management to secure new tenants in the near term.\n\nOverall, while Skogsveien 12 presents a promising investment opportunity in a sought-after location, the challenges of short leases and suboptimal micro-location must be carefully evaluated against the backdrop of the strong rental demand in the Grünerløkka district and its attractive urban amenities.",
