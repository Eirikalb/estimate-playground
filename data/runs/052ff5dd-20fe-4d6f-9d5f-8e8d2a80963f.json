(e.g., \"Office Oslo Centre\", \"Logistics Prime\")\n- What is the benchmark yield range?\n- Choose your starting point within that range (typically the midpoint unless clearly prime/secondary)\n\n**Step 2: Identify All Adjustment Factors**\nList each factor that affects yield and its direction:\n- Tenant quality (AAA/government = DOWN, SME single tenant = UP)\n- Lease length (>10yr WAULT = DOWN, <3yr = UP)\n- Building condition (modern/certified = DOWN, old/needs capex = UP)\n- Location quality (exceptional micro-location = DOWN, poor access = UP)\n- Vacancy risk (>20% vacancy = UP)\n- Diversification (3+ tenants = DOWN)\n\n**Step 3: Calculate with Explicit Arithmetic**\nShow your calculation step by step:\n\nBase: [X.XX]%\n± [Factor 1]: [+/-0.XX]%\n± [Factor 2]: [+/-0.XX]%\n± [Factor 3]: [+/-0.XX]%\n= Final: [X.XX]%\n\n**Step 4: Validation Check**\n- Is the final yield reasonable for this property type?\n- Are all material risk factors accounted for?\n- Does the direction of adjustments make sense?\n\n**Step 5: Return Result**\nReturn ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no code blocks):\n{\"reasoning\": \"<your analysis with explicit calculation from Step 3>\", \"yield\": <number>}\n\nCRITICAL: Your reasoning MUST include the explicit arithmetic calculation from Step 3.

The company specializes in advanced metal fabrication solutions tailored for the aerospace and automotive industries, providing precision components to leading manufacturers.\n\n### Business Model & Metrics\n\nForge Manufacturing operates on a project-based revenue model, characterized by long-term contracts with a diverse client base. Current annual revenue stands at approximately $120M, with a robust portfolio of over 200 active clients, including several Fortune 500 companies. The average contract value (ACV) is around $600K, with a typical project duration of 6-12 months. The company has achieved a Net Revenue Retention (NRR) of 115%, largely driven by successful upselling of new product lines and enhanced service offerings.\n\n### Team & Funding\n\nThe leadership team is anchored by CEO John Mitchell, a veteran entrepreneur with two previous successful exits in the manufacturing sector. CTO Lisa Tran (ex-operations manager at a leading aerospace firm) and CFO Michael Chen (former McKinsey consultant) round out the executive team. The current headcount is approximately 300 employees, with engineering and production staff representing 65% of the workforce, while sales and marketing account for 25% and G&A for the remaining 10%. To date, Forge Manufacturing has raised $80M across Series A and Series B funding rounds, with the latest round led by Sequoia Capital at a $400M post-money valuation in Q2 2024.\n\n### Market Position & Competition\n\nOperating within the $50B advanced manufacturing market, Forge Manufacturing is positioned advantageously due to its specialized offerings and strong client relationships. Competitors include established players such as Precision Castparts and Howmet Aerospace, but Forge differentiates itself through a commitment to innovative production techniques and superior customer service.\n\n### Recent Developments\n\n- Successfully implemented a 10% price increase across the existing client base, resulting in a marked improvement in average revenue per user (ARPU) without significant churn.\n- Despite recent delays in the product roadmap due to supply chain disruptions, the company remains focused on launching two new modular fabrication systems in the upcoming quarter. \n- Expanded its social media presence, raising brand awareness and showcasing client success stories, which has led to a noticeable uptick in inbound sales inquiries.\n- Recently signed a strategic partnership with a leading automotive manufacturer to co-develop next-generation lightweight components, further solidifying its market position.\n\nIn conclusion, while Forge Manufacturing has demonstrated solid performance metrics and a strong market position, it must address the ongoing product roadmap delays and competitive feature gaps to sustain its growth momentum. The successful price increase, paired with strong client retention efforts, provides a favorable outlook for the company's financial trajectory.",

In the current market, prime industrial yields for well-located assets range from 5.50% to 6.50%. Given the specialized nature of precision metal fabrication, I will use a midpoint of 6.00% as the starting benchmark. Step 2: Identify Adjustment Factors. Tenant Quality: Forge Manufacturing is a 'Manufacturing Enterprise' ($120M revenue) with strong backing (Sequoia) and 115% NRR, which is superior to typical SMB manufacturing (Down -0.25%). Lease Length: Assuming a standard long-term industrial lease for a specialized facility (Down -0.15%). Building Condition: Precision manufacturing requires high-spec modern facilities (Down -0.10%). Location: Austin, TX is a high-growth tech/industrial hub (Down -0.20%). Diversification: Single-tenant risk (Up +0.25%). Step 3: Calculate with Explicit Arithmetic. Base: 6.00% - Tenant Quality: 0.25% - Lease Length: 0.15% - Building Condition: 0.10% - Location Quality: 0.20% + Single Tenant Risk: 0.25% = Final: 5.55%. Step 4: Validation Check.
