This location benefits from convenient road access to the E6 motorway, facilitating efficient regional distribution, although the area has limited rail connections. The immediate surroundings are predominantly industrial, featuring a mix of older warehouses and newer logistics facilities, which contribute to the area's overall functionality as a distribution hub. The cadastral designation for this property is gnr. 205, bnr. 14 in Sørum municipality, encompassing an owned plot of 12,300 m².\n\nConstructed in 1998, the building comprises a single-story logistics facility encompassing approximately 6,500 m² BTA. The property features a functional layout optimized for logistics operations, with a clear height of 6 meters and multiple loading docks designed to accommodate various freight vehicles. The building's structure is primarily reinforced concrete, which provides durability and flexibility for various tenant needs. However, the facility shows signs of aging, and significant capital expenditures (capex) are anticipated to modernize the property to meet contemporary logistics standards.\n\nThe tenancy structure currently includes three diverse tenants, ensuring a stable income stream despite an aging building stock. Each tenant operates within the logistics and distribution sectors, capitalizing on the property’s strategic location. The diversified tenant base reflects a healthy demand for space in this secondary logistics area, which is crucial for mitigating vacancy risks and enhancing rental income potential.\n\nRecent technical upgrades to the facility include the installation of new loading dock equipment in 2020, enhancing operational efficiency, and a comprehensive roof refurbishment completed in 2023, which addressed insulation and water tightness issues. However, the rest of the building requires modernization, and the need for additional capex is highlighted by the lack of energy-efficient systems and updated facilities. Currently, the building holds an energy rating of C, indicating room for improvement in sustainability performance.\n\nThe property benefits from a variety of transport connections, including proximity to key arterial roads that facilitate regional logistics operations. Local bus services are available, although rail access is limited in this area, which is not uncommon for secondary logistics locations. Nearby landmarks include the Sørum industrial park and various smaller distribution centers, further solidifying the property's role as a logistical nexus.\n\nThe primary regulatory framework for the property allows for continued use as a logistics facility, with designated areas for storage and distribution cited in the municipal master plan. Future regulatory shifts or infrastructure developments may enhance the appeal of the location, providing an opportunity for growth in rental income and property value.\n\nIn summary, while the property at Lagerveien 42 presents significant opportunities due to its diversified tenant base and strategic location within a secondary logistics area, it is essential to recognize the implications of its older building stock, which necessitates substantial renovation efforts to unlock its full potential. The combination of a well-located property, an established tenant base, and the possibility for modernization could make this an attractive investment for parties interested in the logistics sector.",

          "reasoning": "Step 1: Identify Base Benchmark\nThis property is a logistics facility in Drammen, a secondary location outside Oslo. Built in 1980 with 3,200 m² BTA and 6-meter ceiling height, it represents a normal/secondary logistics asset rather than prime. The benchmark range for 'Logistics Normal & Secondary' is 6.50%–9.50%. Given the property has undergone recent technical upgrades (roof 2015, HVAC 2018, LED 2022) and has reasonable access to E18, I select 7.50% as the starting point (lower-middle of the range).\n\nStep 2: Identify All Adjustment Factors\n- Building age and condition: Constructed 1980, but with significant upgrades (roof, HVAC, LED) = NEUTRAL to slight DOWN (-0.10%)\n- Tenant quality: SME tenants in warehousing/distribution, no credit-rated anchor tenants = UP (+0.40%)\n- Lease structure: Mixed long-term and short-term leases, no disclosed WAULT, suggests moderate lease risk = UP (+0.25%)\n- Location quality: Secondary industrial area in Drammen, 3km from station, 2km from E18, older surrounding stock = NEUTRAL (already reflected in base)\n- Ceiling height: 6 meters is below modern logistics standard (8-10m+) = UP (+0.30%)\n- Building size: 3,200 m² is relatively small for logistics, limiting tenant pool = UP (+0.20%)\n- Vacancy/occupancy: Not disclosed but described as 'mixed profile', suggests some vacancy risk = UP (+0.15%)\n- No environmental certifications (BREEAM/LEED) in market increasingly focused on ESG = UP (+0.10%)\n\nStep 3: Calculate with Explicit Arithmetic\nBase: 7.50%\n+ Building condition (recent upgrades): -0.10%\n+ Tenant quality (SME): +0.40%\n+ Lease structure (mixed short/long): +0.25%\n+ Ceiling height (6m suboptimal): +0.30%\n+ Building size (small): +0.20%\n+ Vacancy risk: +0.15%\n+ No ESG certifications: +0.10%\n= Final: 8.80%\n\nStep 4: Validation Check\nThe final yield of 8.80% sits in the upper portion of the 6.50%–9.50% range for Logistics Normal & Secondary, which is appropriate given: (1) secondary Drammen location, (2) SME tenant base with no credit anchors, (3) suboptimal specifications for modern logistics (6m height, 3,200 m² size), (4) 1980 construction despite upgrades, and (5) lack of environmental certifications. All adjustments are directionally correct and material risk factors are captured.",

          "reasoning": "Step 1: Identify Base Benchmark\nThis property is a logistics facility in Drammen, a secondary location outside Oslo. Built in 1980 with 3,200 m² BTA, 6-meter ceiling height, and serving SME tenants in a secondary industrial area. This clearly falls under 'Logistics Normal & Secondary' segment with benchmark range 6.50%–9.50%. Given the property has some positive attributes (recent technical upgrades, reasonable size, functional design) but is in a secondary location with older building stock, I select 7.75% as the starting midpoint.\n\nStep 2: Identify All Adjustment Factors\n- Tenant quality: SME tenants (warehousing/distribution) = UPWARD pressure (+0.25%)\n- Lease structure: Mixed long-term and short-term leases, no WAULT disclosed = UPWARD pressure (+0.25%)\n- Building age and condition: 1980 construction is old, BUT significant upgrades (roof 2015, HVAC 2018, LED 2022) partially mitigate = NEUTRAL to slight upward (+0.15%)\n- Location quality: Secondary industrial area in Drammen, 3km from station, 2km from E18, limited rail = confirms secondary status, already reflected in base\n- Ceiling height: 6 meters is below modern logistics standard (8-10m typical for prime) = UPWARD pressure (+0.20%)\n- No environmental certifications (BREEAM/LEED) = slight UPWARD pressure (+0.10%)\n- Occupancy/vacancy: Not disclosed but described as 'mixed profile' suggesting some vacancy risk = UPWARD pressure (+0.15%)\n- Size: 3,200 m² is relatively small for logistics, limiting tenant pool = UPWARD pressure (+0.15%)\n\nStep 3: Calculate with Explicit Arithmetic\nBase: 7.75%\n+ Tenant quality (SME): +0.25%\n+ Lease structure uncertainty: +0.25%\n+ Building age factor: +0.15%\n+ Suboptimal ceiling height: +0.20%\n+ No environmental certifications: +0.10%\n+ Vacancy risk: +0.15%\n+ Limited size: +0.15%\n= Final: 9.00%\n\nStep 4: Validation Check\nThe final yield of 9.00% sits at the upper-middle range of the 6.50%–9.50% benchmark for Logistics Normal & Secondary. This is reasonable given: (1) secondary Drammen location, (2) older 1980s building despite upgrades, (3) SME tenant base with mixed lease terms, (4) suboptimal 6m ceiling height for modern logistics, (5) smaller 3,200 m² size limiting institutional appeal. All adjustments are upward from the midpoint, reflecting the cumulative risk factors that position this asset toward the higher-yielding end of secondary logistics. The yield appropriately compensates for the multiple risk factors while recognizing the property's functional utility and recent capital improvements.",
