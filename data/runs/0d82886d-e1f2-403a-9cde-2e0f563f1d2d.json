Given that it is a modern building (post-2015) with a high standard, it would typically command a lower yield of about 15-25 bps. However, the presence of an older building (pre-2000) that requires capex introduces a significant risk factor, likely resulting in a yield expansion of 20-40 bps. The diversified tenant base (3+ tenants) mitigates some risk associated with tenant quality, but since the building requires capital expenditure, the yield adjustment leans towards the higher end. Therefore, starting from a benchmark yield of around 6.25% for office in Trondheim, adjusting for the modern standard (lowering by 20 bps) and then increasing due to the older building needing capex (increasing by 50 bps), results in an estimated yield of 6.75%.",
