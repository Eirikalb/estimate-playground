The property currently holds an energy rating of C, indicative of its sustainable design and operational practices.\n\nThe property operates predominantly as a hotel, catering to corporate clients visiting the area for conferences and business meetings, thus supporting the tenancy structure and generating consistent revenue streams. However, the building is currently let to a single small to medium-sized enterprise (SME) tenant, which presents a concentration risk due to dependency on one entity for rental income.

The cadastral designation is gnr. 174, bnr. 19 in Bergen municipality, with an owned plot size of 1,000 m².\n\nHowever, the property does present some challenges. Its micro-location is suboptimal, characterized by limited visibility from main thoroughfares and somewhat challenging access routes, which may affect foot traffic and overall marketability.

      "contextDescription": "## Property Information\n\n*Overview of property details, ownership, and certifications*\n\nThe property is situated at Verksgata 12 in the vibrant Forus district of Stavanger, strategically located near the intersection of energy sector headquarters and burgeoning international business hubs. This location places it approximately 1 kilometer from Stavanger Cathedral, the Norwegian Petroleum Museum, and the picturesque Vågen harbour. The surrounding area is characterized by a compact city center, which seamlessly blends commercial, retail, and residential spaces, establishing Forus as a pivotal hub for the oil and gas industry. Public transport accessibility is excellent, with frequent bus services operating throughout the district, and proximity to Stavanger station providing regional train connections. The area is also conveniently accessible via main roads, facilitating straightforward travel to the Flesland airport for both domestic and international flights.\n\nThe property is a modern office building constructed in 2010, featuring a sleek design that reflects contemporary architectural standards. It comprises five floors, totaling approximately 2,750 m² BTA, underpinned by strong construction quality with a concrete frame and large glass facades that promote natural light throughout the premises. The cadastral designation is gnr. 24, bnr. 567 in Stavanger municipality, with an owned plot of 1,300 m². The building has been carefully maintained and includes a designated parking area, bicycle storage facilities, and green space that enhances the work environment.\n\nThe property benefits from a diverse tenancy structure primarily focused on the energy sector, with the current occupancy predominantly by a single small to medium-sized enterprise (SME) tenant. While this offers potential for stable cash flow, it is important to note the concentration risk associated with having a single tenant in place. Currently, over 20% of the building is vacant, with additional space anticipated to become available in the near term due to the tenant's strategic operational changes. This vacancy presents both opportunities for new leasing arrangements and challenges related to overall yield.\n\nThe current tenant is an established government contractor, recognized for its service to the oil and gas sector, ensuring a level of creditworthiness typically associated with AAA-rated corporate tenants. However, the lease term is relatively short, with less than three years remaining, highlighting a transitional phase that potential buyers will need to navigate.\n\nRecent technical upgrades to the building include the installation of a state-of-the-art HVAC system in 2021, ensuring compliance with modern energy efficiency standards, and a comprehensive refurbishment of common areas in 2022, enhancing both aesthetics and functionality. Additionally, the building’s energy efficiency has been rated B, reflecting a commitment to sustainable practices, although no additional environmental certifications such as BREEAM or LEED have been reported.\n\nThe regulatory context is supportive, as the property is included in the municipal master plan with the primary purpose of \"bebyggelse og anlegg\", indicating its continued use for office purposes. The surrounding area is expected to see further development, driven by ongoing investments in the energy sector and related industries.\n\nIn terms of management, the property manager has garnered several industry awards for excellence, adding a layer of confidence in operational standards and tenant relations. The seller is highly motivated, seeking a quick transaction, which may provide an advantageous entry point for potential investors looking to capitalize on the evolving commercial landscape in Stavanger’s Forus district.\n\nIn summary, this property presents a unique investment opportunity with significant potential for repositioning following the current lease expiration. With its prime location, solid construction, and a tenant backed by government contracts, this asset is poised for future growth amidst the dynamic energy sector in Norway.",

Positioned approximately 1.5 kilometers from the bustling Sentrum, the building is strategically situated near the Stavanger Cathedral, the Norwegian Petroleum Museum, and the scenic Vågen harbour, which enhances its appeal for both local and international businesses. The property benefits from excellent transport connectivity, with Stavanger station offering regional train services and quick access to the Flesland airport via an extensive bus network, thus underscoring its accessibility for commuters and visitors alike.\n\nConstructed in 1995, the building comprises five floors and offers a gross building area of approximately 3,200 m² BTA. The structure is a modern office building featuring a steel frame with a glass façade, providing a contemporary workspace bathed in natural light. The cadastral designation is gnr. 34, bnr. 17 in Stavanger municipality, with an owned plot size of 1,200 m². The layout accommodates flexible office spaces, complemented by common meeting areas and a café on the ground floor. \n\nHistorically, the property has undergone several technical upgrades to enhance its operational efficiency and tenant comfort. Major improvements include the installation of energy-efficient HVAC systems in 2018, modernization of common areas in 2019, and a full façade refurbishing completed in 2021. However, it is important to note that the building currently faces a significant vacancy rate, exceeding 20%, stemming from the recent decision by its single SME tenant to downsize, resulting in a concentration risk that may affect future rental income. \n\nThe remaining lease period of less than three years for the current tenant introduces the potential for imminent re-leasing challenges. The property's appeal is further complicated by its overdependence on a single tenant, underscoring the importance of diversification in tenant mix moving forward. Despite these concerns, the property also presents an opportunity with the potential to secure a long-term lease with a creditworthy tenant, as evidenced by ongoing discussions with interested parties for a longer-term commitment exceeding ten years.\n\nThe immediate vicinity is dominated by other commercial properties, including headquarters for various energy firms, which illustrates the area’s significance as an oil and gas industry hub. This context lends the property a competitive advantage in attracting new tenants, provided leasing strategies are adjusted to mitigate the current concentration risk. \n\nMoreover, the property management team has garnered several industry awards for excellence in tenant relations and operational efficiency, reflecting a commitment to high standards in property management. This reputation can be leveraged to attract new tenants and secure longer lease terms, which is crucial given the current market dynamics.\n\nThe seller is highly motivated and seeking a quick transaction, thereby presenting a unique opportunity for potential investors to acquire a strategically located asset in a thriving commercial district. Buyers will need to consider the current vacancy, lease term dynamics, and tenant diversification strategies to fully realize the property's potential. \n\nIn summary, Lagårdsveien 38 offers a modern office environment with a supportive infrastructure in an economically vibrant area of Stavanger, yet requires a strategic approach to navigate the challenges posed by its current tenancy situation.",
