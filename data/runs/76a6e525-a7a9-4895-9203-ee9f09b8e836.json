      "contextDescription": "## Property Information\n\n*Overview of property details, ownership, and certifications*\n\nThe property is located at Skogsveien 42 in the vibrant district of Grünerløkka, renowned for its artistic flair and community spirit. Situated approximately 300 metres from the banks of the Aker River and within close proximity to both the lush Frogner Park and the historic Palace Gardens, the location enjoys an ideal balance of urban convenience and natural beauty. Grünerløkka is characterized by its diverse mix of residential and commercial spaces, appealing to a demographic that values culture, leisure, and a lively atmosphere. Public transportation is easily accessible, with metro stations and tram lines nearby, creating efficient connections to the rest of Oslo. The area also boasts well-developed cycling infrastructure, promoting sustainable transport options for residents and visitors alike.\n\nThe building is a modern mixed-use property completed in 2018, consisting of five floors with a total gross building area of approximately 3,200 m² BTA. Constructed with high-quality materials and contemporary design, it features open floor plans, large window façades, and a striking architectural presence that adds to the aesthetic appeal of the Grünerløkka area. The plot is designated gnr. 220, bnr. 34 in Oslo municipality, encompassing approximately 850 m². The property benefits from excellent views of the fjord, providing a unique selling point that enhances its attractiveness to tenants and customers.\n\nThe building's tenancy structure is largely defined by a strong anchor tenant, who has committed to a long-term lease with a weighted average unexpired lease term (WAULT) exceeding 10 years. This provides a stable income stream and reduces vacancy risk, making the property an attractive investment opportunity. However, it is crucial to note that there is also a portion of the building that is under a short lease, with less than three years remaining. This dual leasing structure presents potential for future rental growth, particularly as the market continues to thrive in this desirable location.\n\nIn terms of technical specifications, the property has undergone several enhancements since its completion, ensuring it remains compliant with modern standards and tenant expectations. Key upgrades include the installation of energy-efficient HVAC systems in 2020, the addition of solar panels in 2021, and the refurbishment of common areas in 2022. These improvements not only elevate the tenant experience but also contribute to lower operational costs and a reduced environmental footprint.\n\nWhile the property is primarily utilized for commercial purposes, it also includes residential units, catering to the increasing demand for live-work spaces in urban environments. The mixed-use nature of the building enhances its appeal, drawing a diverse range of tenants, from creative agencies to lifestyle brands. The proximity to essential urban amenities, such as cafes, restaurants, and retail outlets, further bolsters its attractiveness and ensures a robust rental demand.\n\nThe property is regulated under the municipal master plan with a focus on \"bebyggelse og anlegg (fremtidig),\" allowing for various uses within the mixed-use framework. Current tenants reflect an eclectic mix of businesses that align with the vibrant character of Grünerløkka, contributing to the area’s dynamic economic landscape. \n\nIn summary, this property at Skogsveien 42 presents a compelling investment opportunity within a high-demand residential area characterized by strong rental yields and urban amenities. With its strategic location, modern construction, and solid lease agreements, it stands as a valuable asset in Oslo's commercial real estate market.",

Positioned just 300 metres from the scenic Aker River and within a short walking distance of the popular Grünerløkka Park, the building benefits from its proximity to both natural beauty and urban amenities. The area is characterized by a mix of established residential buildings, cafes, restaurants, and boutique shops, creating a lively environment with strong rental demand. Public transport is easily accessible via the nearby metro station at Grünerløkka and several tram lines, ensuring connectivity to the greater Oslo region. The local infrastructure supports cycling, with dedicated bike lanes promoting sustainable transport options. The cadastral designation for this property is gnr. 221, bnr. 45 in Oslo municipality, with a plot area of 750 m².\n\nThe building, originally constructed in 1998, features a modern design with clean lines and large window surfaces that enhance natural light throughout the interior. It comprises five floors with a total gross building area of approximately 2,500 m² BTA. The structure is a combination of reinforced concrete and steel, resulting in a robust and durable asset. The property is characterized by flexible floor plates of around 500 m², allowing for a variety of tenant configurations. Notably, the building offers stunning views of the fjord, enhancing its appeal to potential tenants.\n\nDespite its modern construction, the property requires capital expenditures (capex) to address maintenance and refurbishment needs. This is crucial as the building was last significantly upgraded in 2015 when new energy-efficient heating systems and exterior façade enhancements were installed to improve both aesthetics and performance. Recent inspections indicate that the building's systems are operational but will benefit from a comprehensive renovation to align with contemporary standards. Additionally, there is a current vacancy of over 20% within the property, with several units becoming available shortly due to the expiration of existing leases, which are all less than three years in duration. This imminent vacancy presents an opportunity for a new owner to reposition the asset and capture value through lease-up strategies.\n\nThe property is regulated under the municipal master plan focusing on mixed-use development, and while it primarily serves as a residential building with retail on the ground floor, it holds potential for reimagining spaces for commercial use given its strategic location. The tenant mix currently includes artisanal shops, small professional offices, and residential units, with a notable demand for modern living spaces in this culturally rich area. \n\nDocumented technical upgrades beyond the mentioned enhancements are limited, with no recent certifications such as BREEAM or LEED reported. However, the property has demonstrated compliance with historical building regulations, and the energy rating is classified as D (average), reflecting the need for further improvements to achieve higher sustainability standards.\n\nIn summary, Skogsveien 12 presents a compelling investment opportunity in a sought-after location. With its modern construction, potential for redevelopment, and prime views of the fjord, it offers a unique chance for investors to tap into the high rental demand in Grünerløkka. The forthcoming vacancies and the need for capital improvements provide a pathway to enhance property value through strategic asset management and tenant engagement.",

Notable improvements include the installation of energy-efficient HVAC systems in 2015, the addition of enhanced security features in 2017, and a complete refurbishment of the common areas in 2019 to elevate the shopping experience for visitors. The building is compliant with current energy regulations, although specific certifications such as BREEAM or LEED have not been pursued, which may provide future opportunities for enhancement.\n\nThe property is regulated under the municipal master plan with a primary designation for retail use, allowing for a mix of commercial activities that align with the ongoing development of Sandnes as a suburban retail centre. The tenancy structure is currently weighted towards essential retail goods and services, catering to the daily needs of local residents and passing trade. Traffic flow is bolstered by the close proximity to public transport links, including bus services to Stavanger and surrounding areas, although the site remains predominantly car-oriented due to the nature of its clientele.\n\nIn summary, Torggata 5 presents a unique investment opportunity in a growing suburban retail market, characterized by a strong anchor tenant with a long lease, a diversified tenant base, and the potential for value enhancement through strategic leasing efforts. With ongoing developments in the surrounding area and a stable customer base, this property is well-positioned for future growth.",

The site enjoys excellent car-dependent access, with a large parking area accommodating over 150 vehicles, ensuring convenience for consumers. Proximity to the E39 highway further enhances accessibility to and from the property, allowing for efficient traffic flow and easy access to surrounding districts.\n\nThe property itself is a modern retail building, completed in 2018, featuring a sleek and contemporary design that adheres to high construction standards.

The combined presence of these tenants reinforces the site's retail viability, although the property itself currently faces a notable challenge, with an imminent vacancy rate exceeding 20% due to a recent downsizing of one of the retail tenants. This situation represents both a risk and an opportunity for prospective investors, driven by the overall dependence on anchor tenants to maintain occupancy levels.\n\nThe building has been well-maintained, with a series of technical upgrades implemented since its completion in 2018, including enhanced energy-efficient HVAC systems in 2019, improved exterior signage in 2020, and optimized internal lighting systems in 2021, all contributing to a modern shopping environment with reduced operating costs. The energy performance certificate for the property indicates a rating of B, demonstrating its commitment to sustainability and energy efficiency.\n\nThe tenancy structure features a long lease with a creditworthy tenant occupying approximately 70% of the net lettable area, secured for over 10 years. This long Weighted Average Unexpired Lease Term (WAULT) presents a strong income foundation for investors in a secondary retail location. However, the current market landscape necessitates attention to the approaching vacancy, which highlights the importance of strategic marketing and potential re-letting initiatives to maximize yield.\n\nRegulatory frameworks allow for a diverse range of commercial uses, providing flexibility for potential redevelopment or re-leasing opportunities. The property is not currently listed for any environmental certifications such as BREEAM or LEED, which could present an area for future enhancement to elevate asset value and appeal to environmentally-conscious tenants.\n\nOwnership of the property has been retained by the current owner for the past 15 years, reflecting a long-term commitment to the asset.

It lies approximately 300 meters from Nordstrand station and within a short distance to the popular Manglerud shopping center, providing a vibrant urban edge to this suburban setting. The area is primarily characterized by low-rise buildings, green spaces, and ample amenities, making it an attractive location for businesses looking to establish themselves in a suburban environment with a distinct community feel. Public transport links are robust, with Ryen metro station just a 10-minute walk away, complemented by easy access to the E6 motorway and suburban train connections.\n\nThe building is a modern office property completed in 2018, featuring a contemporary design that aligns with the high standards expected by today’s tenants. It comprises five floors, including a ground floor, and offers a gross building area of approximately 3,200 m² BTA. The structure is constructed with reinforced concrete and glass facades, promoting natural light and energy efficiency. The property is situated on a plot of 1,200 m², with cadastral references gnr. 234, bnr. 12 in Oslo municipality.\n\nThe interior layout has been thoughtfully designed to accommodate a single tenant, which is currently a well-established SME operating within the technology sector. The long lease agreement in place extends beyond 10 years, indicating a solid commitment from a creditworthy tenant. However, it is important to note that the property currently has a vacancy rate exceeding 20%, presenting a unique opportunity for potential investors to enhance the asset's income-generating capabilities.\n\nIn terms of technical specifications, the building has undergone several key upgrades since its construction. Notable enhancements include the installation of a state-of-the-art HVAC system in 2019, which contributes to improved energy efficiency and tenant comfort. In 2021, the building's common areas were refurbished, including the lobby and stairwells, ensuring a welcoming environment for employees and visitors alike. The property has been rated with an energy classification of B, reflecting its modern construction and energy-saving features.\n\nThe zoning regulations as per the municipal master plan designate the property for \"bebyggelse og anlegg (fremtidig),\" primarily supporting office use. The tenancy structure highlights the single-tenant profile, with additional space available for potential future leasing opportunities. The property benefits from a strategic position along Ekebergveien, which is a key arterial route facilitating car-dependent access while simultaneously offering a tranquil suburban atmosphere.\n\nSurrounding landmarks, such as the picturesque Ekebergparken sculpture park and the charming residential areas of Nordstrand, enhance the property's appeal as a desirable office location. The blend of accessibility, modern specifications, and surrounding amenities makes this property an attractive investment opportunity in Oslo's evolving commercial landscape. However, the concentration risk associated with the single SME tenant should be carefully considered by potential buyers, as the current vacancy presents both a challenge and an opportunity for future growth. Overall, Ekebergveien 27 represents a compelling option for investors seeking to capitalize on Oslo's dynamic real estate market while acknowledging the inherent risks associated with tenant concentration.",

The building comprises five stories, encompassing a gross building area of approximately 3,200 m² BTA, with a built-up area of 640 m². The property is constructed using reinforced concrete, ensuring durability and structural resilience.

The building currently holds an energy rating of B, reflecting its modern standards and energy-efficient features.\n\nThe property is primarily utilized as an office space, accommodating a single small to medium-sized enterprise (SME) tenant. While the occupancy has initially provided stability, it is important to note that the current vacancy exceeds 20%, creating potential for future repositioning and value enhancement. The tenant concentration presents a level of risk, as the property relies predominantly on this single occupant for its income stream.\n\nThe surrounding area is characterized by a mix of residential and commercial properties, creating a supportive environment for businesses. The accessibility to the Ryen metro station and suburban train connections adds significant convenience for employees commuting to and from the office.
