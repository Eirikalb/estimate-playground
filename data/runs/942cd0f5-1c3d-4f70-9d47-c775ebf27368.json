      "contextDescription": "## Property Information\n\n*Overview of property details, ownership, and certifications*\n\nThe property is located at Tollbugata 30 in the heart of Oslo's central business district, strategically positioned between the iconic Oslo Cathedral and the historical Parliament building. This prime location benefits from proximity to some of Oslo's most significant landmarks, including the Central Station, the Opera House, and the Munch Museum, making it an attractive destination for both tenants and visitors. The immediate area is characterized by a vibrant mix of retail, commercial, and cultural institutions, contributing to a bustling urban atmosphere. Accessibility is exceptional, with Oslo Central Station providing connections to all metro lines and national rail services, while the Jernbanetorget metro hub and an extensive tram network ensure seamless public transport options. The property’s location on Tollbugata further enhances its visibility and accessibility within this pedestrian-friendly zone.\n\nThe building is a modern office structure completed in 2003, featuring an innovative design that incorporates sustainable construction materials and practices. It comprises six floors with a total gross building area of approximately 3,200 m² BTA and an effective plot size of 800 m², designated as gnr. 215, bnr. 21 in Oslo municipality. The design emphasizes functional office space that facilitates collaboration and productivity, while each floor benefits from large window surfaces providing abundant natural light. The property is characterized by its steel-frame construction and energy-efficient systems, resulting in a contemporary workspace that meets the demands of modern businesses.\n\nRecent technical upgrades include the installation of new energy-efficient HVAC systems in 2021, a comprehensive refurbishment of the lobby and common areas in 2022, and the implementation of a smart building management system in 2023. These upgrades not only enhance the tenant experience but also contribute to the property’s sustainability profile. The building currently holds an energy rating of B (medium green), indicative of its compliance with contemporary energy standards. Although no specific environmental certifications such as BREEAM or LEED are reported, the emphasis on energy efficiency and modern systems aligns with current industry standards.\n\nThe property is predominantly utilized as an office space with a notable single tenant—a small to medium enterprise (SME)—occupying the entire building under a short lease agreement with less than three years remaining. This concentration of tenancy creates a degree of concentration risk, which potential buyers should be aware of when evaluating the property. The tenant, however, is a government-related entity with a strong financial standing, providing a level of security typically associated with government or AAA-rated corporate tenants. The existing lease terms reflect the evolving needs of the tenant, ensuring flexibility in future occupancy arrangements.\n\nThe property is part of a zoning plan that allows for continued use as an office building, with potential for mixed-use development in the future should market conditions allow. The office spaces are designed to accommodate various professional services and knowledge-based industries, reflecting the surrounding economic landscape that thrives on innovation and collaboration. With floor plates averaging approximately 550 m², the layout facilitates both open-plan and private office configurations, appealing to a diverse range of tenants.\n\nIn conclusion, Tollbugata 30 presents an opportunity to acquire a well-situated, modern office property in Oslo's central district. While the current tenant's concentration reflects a particular risk profile, the strong governmental affiliation and the prospect of re-leasing or repositioning the property in the near term could provide significant value to prospective investors. The building's recent upgrades further enhance its appeal, ensuring it meets the demands of today's workforce while positioning itself within a dynamic urban environment.",

The mix promotes a stable income generation profile while offering potential for reconfiguration of space to meet evolving market demands. The building's layout allows for easy re-letting or remodeling opportunities, making it adaptable to future tenant needs. \n\nSustainability initiatives have been implemented, including the integration of energy-efficient systems and materials, though no third-party environmental certifications such as BREEAM or LEED have been reported.

It should sit towards the lower to mid-range of the benchmark, around 5.50% to 6.00%. Step 3: Adjustments: - Tenant quality and creditworthiness: The single SME tenant presents a concentration risk, which pushes the yield up (more risk). - Lease length and WAULT: The stability of the current lease is a positive factor, pushing the yield down (less risk). - Building age and condition: The building is modern (completed in 2005) and has undergone recent upgrades, which pushes the yield down (less risk). - Special factors: The prime location and energy efficiency improvements push the yield down (less risk). Overall, the concentration risk from having a single tenant increases the yield, while the quality of the building and location decreases it. Considering these factors, I estimate the final yield to be 5.75%.",
