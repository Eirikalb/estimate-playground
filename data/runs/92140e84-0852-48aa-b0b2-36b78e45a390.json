While a motivated seller often implies a 'liquidity discount' that could push the yield toward the higher end (expansion) to ensure a quick closing, the lack of negative property-specific indicators (such as short WAULT or high capex) suggests a neutral market position. This yield reflects a balanced risk profile for a secondary Oslo hub, accounting for the current high interest rate environment and the specific geographical risk premium associated with the East corridor compared to the CBD.",

          "reasoning": "The benchmark for Office Oslo East is 5.75%–7.25%. Given the lack of specific data on building age, WAULT, or tenant credit, I have positioned the asset at the midpoint of the range (6.50%). While the seller's high motivation and desire for a quick transaction typically necessitate a 'liquidity premium' or a slightly higher yield to attract immediate capital, this is balanced against the current Q3 2024 market sentiment where Oslo East offers a yield spread that is increasingly attractive to value-add and opportunistic investors. A 6.50% yield represents a fair market entry point that accounts for the inherent secondary location risk while remaining competitive enough to facilitate the requested expedited closing.",
