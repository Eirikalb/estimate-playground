This location benefits from convenient road access to the E6 motorway, facilitating efficient regional distribution, although the area has limited rail connections. The immediate surroundings are predominantly industrial, featuring a mix of older warehouses and newer logistics facilities, which contribute to the area's overall functionality as a distribution hub. The cadastral designation for this property is gnr. 205, bnr. 14 in Sørum municipality, encompassing an owned plot of 12,300 m².\n\nConstructed in 1998, the building comprises a single-story logistics facility encompassing approximately 6,500 m² BTA. The property features a functional layout optimized for logistics operations, with a clear height of 6 meters and multiple loading docks designed to accommodate various freight vehicles. The building's structure is primarily reinforced concrete, which provides durability and flexibility for various tenant needs. However, the facility shows signs of aging, and significant capital expenditures (capex) are anticipated to modernize the property to meet contemporary logistics standards.\n\nThe tenancy structure currently includes three diverse tenants, ensuring a stable income stream despite an aging building stock. Each tenant operates within the logistics and distribution sectors, capitalizing on the property’s strategic location. The diversified tenant base reflects a healthy demand for space in this secondary logistics area, which is crucial for mitigating vacancy risks and enhancing rental income potential.\n\nRecent technical upgrades to the facility include the installation of new loading dock equipment in 2020, enhancing operational efficiency, and a comprehensive roof refurbishment completed in 2023, which addressed insulation and water tightness issues. However, the rest of the building requires modernization, and the need for additional capex is highlighted by the lack of energy-efficient systems and updated facilities. Currently, the building holds an energy rating of C, indicating room for improvement in sustainability performance.\n\nThe property benefits from a variety of transport connections, including proximity to key arterial roads that facilitate regional logistics operations. Local bus services are available, although rail access is limited in this area, which is not uncommon for secondary logistics locations. Nearby landmarks include the Sørum industrial park and various smaller distribution centers, further solidifying the property's role as a logistical nexus.\n\nThe primary regulatory framework for the property allows for continued use as a logistics facility, with designated areas for storage and distribution cited in the municipal master plan. Future regulatory shifts or infrastructure developments may enhance the appeal of the location, providing an opportunity for growth in rental income and property value.\n\nIn summary, while the property at Lagerveien 42 presents significant opportunities due to its diversified tenant base and strategic location within a secondary logistics area, it is essential to recognize the implications of its older building stock, which necessitates substantial renovation efforts to unlock its full potential. The combination of a well-located property, an established tenant base, and the possibility for modernization could make this an attractive investment for parties interested in the logistics sector.",

Nearby landmarks include the popular Manglerud shopping center and the picturesque Ekebergparken sculpture park, which enriches the urban landscape and provides recreational opportunities for tenants and visitors alike. The area is characterized by its suburban office location, with a lower cost profile compared to inner-city districts, appealing to small and medium-sized enterprises reliant on car-dependent access.\n\nThe building is a modern office structure completed in 2010, featuring a sleek design with a total gross building area of approximately 3,250 m² BTA. The property encompasses five floors, all offering flexible floor plates averaging 650 m², designed to cater to the diverse needs of contemporary office users. Constructed with high-quality materials, the building has large window surfaces that provide ample natural light, contributing to a productive work environment. The cadastral designation is gnr. 134, bnr. 24 in Oslo municipality, covering a plot size of 1,200 m².\n\nThe property is let to a single SME tenant, which presents a concentration risk; however, the lease has a weighted average unexpired lease term (WAULT) exceeding 10 years, significantly mitigating the risk of vacancy and providing a stable income stream for the owner. This long lease term with a creditworthy tenant underscores the attractiveness of the investment, as it aligns with the demand for secure, long-term commitments in the current market landscape.\n\nNotable technical upgrades have been implemented since the building’s completion, enhancing its appeal and functionality. These upgrades include the installation of energy-efficient HVAC systems in 2015, the introduction of high-speed internet and advanced telecommunications infrastructure in 2018, and a comprehensive refurbishment of the building’s interior in 2021, which included modernized common areas and improved accessibility features. These enhancements not only elevate the tenant experience but also align with contemporary sustainability practices, as the property holds an energy rating of B (green), reflecting its commitment to energy efficiency and environmental responsibility.\n\nRegulatory conditions for the property are favorable, as it is governed by the municipal master plan with the primary designation for office use. The tenancy structure is predominantly comprised of professional services, with a focus on knowledge-intensive activities, ensuring a robust demand for the office space. The building has been consistently occupied since its completion, with the current lease arrangement underscoring a strong tenant relationship bolstered by the long-term commitment.\n\nAs part of the broader economic landscape, the property is strategically positioned to benefit from ongoing developments within the Nordstrand area and beyond.
