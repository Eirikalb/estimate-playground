This location benefits from convenient road access to the E6 motorway, facilitating efficient regional distribution, although the area has limited rail connections. The immediate surroundings are predominantly industrial, featuring a mix of older warehouses and newer logistics facilities, which contribute to the area's overall functionality as a distribution hub. The cadastral designation for this property is gnr. 205, bnr. 14 in Sørum municipality, encompassing an owned plot of 12,300 m².\n\nConstructed in 1998, the building comprises a single-story logistics facility encompassing approximately 6,500 m² BTA. The property features a functional layout optimized for logistics operations, with a clear height of 6 meters and multiple loading docks designed to accommodate various freight vehicles. The building's structure is primarily reinforced concrete, which provides durability and flexibility for various tenant needs. However, the facility shows signs of aging, and significant capital expenditures (capex) are anticipated to modernize the property to meet contemporary logistics standards.\n\nThe tenancy structure currently includes three diverse tenants, ensuring a stable income stream despite an aging building stock. Each tenant operates within the logistics and distribution sectors, capitalizing on the property’s strategic location. The diversified tenant base reflects a healthy demand for space in this secondary logistics area, which is crucial for mitigating vacancy risks and enhancing rental income potential.\n\nRecent technical upgrades to the facility include the installation of new loading dock equipment in 2020, enhancing operational efficiency, and a comprehensive roof refurbishment completed in 2023, which addressed insulation and water tightness issues. However, the rest of the building requires modernization, and the need for additional capex is highlighted by the lack of energy-efficient systems and updated facilities. Currently, the building holds an energy rating of C, indicating room for improvement in sustainability performance.\n\nThe property benefits from a variety of transport connections, including proximity to key arterial roads that facilitate regional logistics operations. Local bus services are available, although rail access is limited in this area, which is not uncommon for secondary logistics locations. Nearby landmarks include the Sørum industrial park and various smaller distribution centers, further solidifying the property's role as a logistical nexus.\n\nThe primary regulatory framework for the property allows for continued use as a logistics facility, with designated areas for storage and distribution cited in the municipal master plan. Future regulatory shifts or infrastructure developments may enhance the appeal of the location, providing an opportunity for growth in rental income and property value.\n\nIn summary, while the property at Lagerveien 42 presents significant opportunities due to its diversified tenant base and strategic location within a secondary logistics area, it is essential to recognize the implications of its older building stock, which necessitates substantial renovation efforts to unlock its full potential. The combination of a well-located property, an established tenant base, and the possibility for modernization could make this an attractive investment for parties interested in the logistics sector.",

          "reasoning": "**Step 1: Identify Base Benchmark**\n\nThis property is a logistics/warehouse facility in Drammen, which falls under \"Other Cities\" from a geographic perspective. The property description explicitly mentions it's in a \"secondary industrial area\" with \"older building stock.\"\n\n**Benchmark segment:** Logistics Normal & Secondary\n**Benchmark yield range:** 6.50%–9.50%\n\nGiven the property is described as secondary (not prime), I'll start at the midpoint of this range: **8.00%**\n\n**Step 2: Identify All Adjustment Factors**\n\n| Factor | Assessment | Direction |\n|--------|------------|-----------|\n| **Location quality** | Drammen secondary industrial area, 2km from E18, 3km from rail station - decent but not prime logistics corridor | Neutral to slight UP |\n| **Building age/condition** | Built 1980 (44 years old), but with meaningful upgrades (roof 2015, HVAC 2018, LED 2022) | Slight DOWN |\n| **Tenant quality** | SMEs in warehousing/distribution - not institutional grade tenants | UP |\n| **Lease structure** | Mixed long-term and short-term leases, no WAULT disclosed - uncertainty | UP |\n| **Vacancy risk** | Occupancy details not disclosed - red flag suggesting potential vacancy | UP |\n| **Building specifications** | 6m clear height is below modern logistics standards (10m+), single-story, 3,200 m² is small | UP |\n| **Sustainability/Certification** | No BREEAM/LEED, basic energy improvements only | Slight UP |\n| **Plot ownership** | Freehold (owned plot) - positive | Slight DOWN |\n\n**Step 3: Calculate with Explicit Arithmetic**\n\n```\nBase (Logistics Normal & Secondary midpoint):     8.00%\n+ Location (secondary area, not prime corridor):  +0.25%\n- Building upgrades (roof, HVAC, LED recent):     -0.25%\n+ Tenant quality (SME profile, not institutional): +0.35%\n+ Lease uncertainty (mixed terms, no WAULT):      +0.30%\n+ Vacancy risk (undisclosed occupancy):           +0.25%\n+ Building specs (low ceiling, small scale):      +0.35%\n+ No sustainability certification:                +0.10%\n- Freehold ownership:                             -0.10%\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────\n= Final:                                          9.25%\n```\n\n**Step 4: Validation Check**\n\n- **Reasonableness:** 9.25% falls within the Logistics Normal & Secondary range of 6.50%–9.50%, near the upper end which is appropriate for a secondary property\n- **Risk factors accounted for:** Yes - older building, SME tenants, undisclosed vacancy, substandard specs, secondary location\n- **Direction logic:** All adjustments directionally correct - risk factors push yield up, positive attributes (upgrades, freehold) push down\n- **Market context:** For a 1980s-built secondary logistics asset in Drammen with SME tenants and limited disclosure, upper-quartile yield is justified\n\n{\"reasoning\": \"Property segment: Logistics Normal & Secondary in Drammen (Other Cities). Benchmark range: 6.50%-9.50%. Starting at midpoint of 8.00%. Adjustments: +0.25% for secondary industrial location; -0.25% for recent building upgrades (roof 2015, HVAC 2018, LED 2022); +0.35% for SME tenant profile (not institutional grade); +0.30% for lease structure uncertainty (mixed terms, no WAULT disclosed); +0.25% for vacancy risk (occupancy not disclosed); +0.35% for substandard building specifications (6m ceiling height below modern 10m+ standard, small 3,200 m² footprint); +0.10% for lack of sustainability certifications; -0.10% for freehold ownership. Calculation: 8.00% + 0.25% - 0.25% + 0.35% + 0.30% + 0.25% + 0.35% + 0.10% - 0.10% = 9.25%. Final yield of 9.25% is within the benchmark range and reflects the secondary nature of this older logistics",
