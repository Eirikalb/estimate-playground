The immediate vicinity of the property benefits from a diverse mix of light industrial and logistics users, creating a robust ecosystem for businesses requiring logistics support.

The building, constructed in 2018, represents a modern logistics facility designed to high standards with a gross building area (BTA) of 3,150 m². The structure is constructed from reinforced concrete, featuring a high-clearance warehouse and integrated office space, tailored to meet the needs of contemporary logistics operations. \n\nDesigned to optimize functionality, the building comprises a single floor with a well-planned layout conducive to both storage and operational needs. The facility has been equipped with energy-efficient systems, enhancing its operational efficiency and reducing long-term running costs. Additionally, the property holds an energy rating of C, reflecting its compliance with recent Norwegian energy regulations and sustainability standards.\n\nTransportation access is facilitated via Logistikkveien, connecting to the E18 motorway, which provides direct routes to Oslo and other key regional destinations. While road access is strong, it is noteworthy that the property has limited rail connections, which may impact logistics efficiencies for certain tenants. Public transport options are available within a short driving distance, offering additional connectivity for employees commuting to the facility.\n\nThe surrounding area is characterized by older building stock, with many facilities dating prior to 2015, creating a distinctive contrast with this modern development. This property’s high-quality standards and recent construction position it as an attractive option for prospective tenants seeking state-of-the-art logistics space. However, potential buyers should be aware that the smaller tenant base typical of secondary industrial areas may result in higher vacancy risks than in more established logistics hubs.\n\nSignificant technical upgrades have been implemented since the building's completion, enhancing the overall functionality and market appeal. Notable enhancements include the installation of advanced security systems and LED lighting throughout the facility in 2019, alongside an upgraded HVAC system in 2021, ensuring optimal climate control and energy efficiency.

Overall, the modern nature of the building, combined with its strategic location within a secondary logistics area, presents a unique investment opportunity, albeit tempered by the inherent challenges associated with its micro-location.",

Approximately 10 kilometers from Oslo Airport Gardermoen, the site enjoys excellent transport accessibility, with an efficient airport shuttle service and direct connections to the E18 highway.

The plot extends to 3,500 m², offering generous outdoor space and landscaping that enhances the guest experience.\n\nWithin the hotel, guests are provided with 150 well-appointed guest rooms, a business center, meeting rooms, and recreational facilities, including a gym and a restaurant with capacity for 120 patrons. The hotel has been strategically designed to cater to seasonal variations in occupancy, focusing on corporate rates during weekdays and catering to tourists during weekends and holiday periods.\n\nNotably, the property’s micro-location on Hotellplassen is less than optimal, as it is slightly removed from high-traffic areas, leading to limited visibility from the main access routes. While the building enjoys convenient access to the airport and conference centers, the surrounding area does not attract significant pedestrian footfall, which can impact the hotel's performance during off-peak seasons. This factor should be carefully considered as it may influence overall yield.\n\nThe property has undergone several technical upgrades since its completion, including the installation of energy-efficient heating and cooling systems in 2014, a full refurbishment of guest rooms in 2018, and the addition of solar panels on the roof in 2020 to enhance sustainability. More recent improvements include the renovation of the lobby and public areas in early 2023, providing a modern and welcoming atmosphere for guests. Despite these enhancements, the current energy rating remains at C, which could be improved with further upgrades.\n\nThe hotel is currently operational and has established a mixed tenant structure, predominantly catering to business travelers, corporate clients, and conference attendees. The leasing strategy emphasizes long-term corporate contracts, though the dependency on corporate rates may pose challenges during economic downturns. The property is not currently certified under additional sustainability schemes such as BREEAM or LEED, but ongoing discussions for future certifications are in place, aligning with broader trends in the hotel sector towards sustainable hospitality.\n\nThe property is regulated under the municipal master plan for mixed-use development, allowing for potential future expansion or diversification of services. Overall, the hotel at Hotellplassen 5 presents a unique opportunity for investors seeking to engage with the growing tourism and business sectors in Norway, despite acknowledged challenges related to its micro-location and visibility.",

      "contextDescription": "## Property Information\n\n*Overview of property details, ownership, and certifications*\n\nThe property is located at Bogstadveien 45 in the vibrant Majorstuen district of Oslo, known for its dynamic retail scene and affluent residential neighborhoods. Positioned approximately 150 metres from Majorstuen Metro Station, this prime retail property benefits from high footfall and excellent visibility, surrounded by well-established international brands and diverse dining options. Majorstuen serves as a crucial transport hub, offering seamless connections to the city’s extensive metro, tram, and bus networks, catering to the daily commuting needs of both residents and visitors. The area is characterized by a mix of high street shopping and cultural institutions, reinforcing its standing as one of Oslo's foremost retail destinations.\n\nThe building is a modern retail property originally constructed in 2005, featuring an appealing façade that integrates glass and steel elements, enhancing its contemporary aesthetic. The property comprises three floors with a total gross building area of approximately 2,500 m² BTA. The ground floor offers 1,200 m² of prime retail space, while the first and second floors include additional retail units and office spaces, promoting a diversified tenant base that enhances foot traffic and consumer engagement. The cadastral designation is gnr. 216, bnr. 45 in Oslo municipality, with an owned plot of 500 m².\n\nThe immediate vicinity boasts notable landmarks such as the Oslo City shopping centre, Steen & Strøm, and Glasmagasinet, all of which contribute to the area's reputation as a shopping haven. Additionally, the presence of popular cafes, restaurants, and entertainment facilities creates a vibrant atmosphere, attracting a diverse clientele. Despite its overall prime location, certain aspects of the property's micro-location may present challenges, such as slightly suboptimal visibility from the main thoroughfare, which could affect brand exposure for potential tenants.\n\nThe building features significant technical upgrades that have been implemented since its construction. In 2018, substantial renovations included the installation of energy-efficient HVAC systems and modern LED lighting throughout the retail spaces, greatly enhancing energy performance and tenant comfort. In 2021, the façade received a comprehensive refurbishment, updating its aesthetic appeal and improving insulation properties, which align with contemporary sustainability standards. Further improvements in 2022 included the installation of a new security system and enhanced signage capabilities to improve tenant visibility.\n\nThe tenancy structure is diversified, comprising three active tenants, including a well-known fashion retailer, a gourmet café, and a specialty health and wellness store. This diversified tenant mix not only boosts the overall vibrancy of the shopping experience but also mitigates the risk associated with reliance on a single tenant. The current occupancy rate is robust, with only one unit available for lease, reflecting the high demand for retail space in this sought-after location.\n\nThe property is regulated under the municipal master plan for commercial use, allowing for future enhancement opportunities, which may include expansion or additional retail offerings, subject to municipal approvals. Property-level sustainability initiatives beyond the noted technical upgrades have not been specified, and no additional environmental certifications, such as BREEAM or LEED, have been reported in the information provided.\n\nThe transaction is expected to close in Q4, representing a compelling opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on the strong consumer spending trends and the ongoing urban development in Oslo's retail landscape. With its strategic location, diversified tenant base, and history of substantial upgrades, this property stands as a valuable asset in the heart of Majorstuen.",
