However, it is important to note that the building remains an older structure, constructed prior to 2000, and therefore will require capital expenditures in the near future to maintain modern standards and competitiveness within the market. The current or imminent vacancy level exceeds 20%, which presents an opportunity for value enhancement through strategic leasing initiatives or redevelopment.\n\nRegarded within the municipal master plan, the property is designated primarily for \"kontorformål\" (office purposes), allowing for continued use as a commercial office building with potential for complementary retail or service functions on the ground floor. The tenant composition, as detailed in the sales presentation and structured data, predominantly consists of professional services, including consultancies and tech firms, though the existing vacancy rate presents challenges in optimizing rental income. \n\nThe building's energy rating is classified as C, reflecting moderate energy efficiency while still providing room for improvements that could align with contemporary sustainability expectations.

This prime location is approximately 300 metres from Skøyen station, providing exceptional connectivity through both regional and local train services, alongside convenient bus connections to the city centre. The surroundings feature notable landmarks such as Sjølyst shopping centre and CC Vest, enhancing its appeal to potential tenants. Additionally, Hoff Park is in close proximity, offering green recreational spaces that contribute to the area’s livability and work-life balance.

It is structured with reinforced concrete and features a modern façade with large glass windows that allow ample natural light into the office spaces. The cadastral designation is gnr. 198, bnr. 45 in Oslo municipality, encompassing a plot of 1,200 m². Notably, this property exhibits characteristics of an earlier era, as it was completed prior to the year 2000. As such, it may require capital expenditure (capex) to modernize facilities and enhance energy efficiency, which is an important factor for future investment considerations.\n\nInternally, the building hosts a variety of configurations across its floors, typically offering layouts between 300 m² to 650 m² per office unit. While the building benefits from a diverse tenant mix predominantly composed of professional services and creative industries, there are currently some challenges related to its micro-location. The site suffers from suboptimal visibility and access, which may impact overall tenant attraction. This aspect requires careful strategic planning to enhance the building's competitive posture in the market.\n\nRecent upgrades to the property include the installation of a new heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system in 2021, which has significantly improved energy efficiency levels and tenant comfort. However, the building does require additional capex investments to modernize common areas and enhance technical facilities further. In 2022, a comprehensive refurbishment of the lobby area was completed, featuring new flooring and updated reception facilities, which has improved the first impression for visitors and tenants alike. While there is no current energy rating or environmental certification such as BREEAM or LEED reported for the building, the upgrades undertaken indicate a commitment to improving operational efficiency and tenant satisfaction.\n\nThe property is regulated under the municipal master plan primarily for commercial use, allowing for future expansion or modification within the existing envelope. The surrounding area is characterized by a mixed-use development strategy, integrating residential components that contribute to the local workforce and create a vibrant community atmosphere. Office units in the building currently comprise a mix of fully leased spaces, alongside a few vacant units that present an opportunity for potential buyers to increase occupancy.\n\nIn conclusion, while Hoffsveien 22 presents an established office building within a sought-after location in Skøyen, prospective investors should be aware of the necessary capex requirements and the impact of its suboptimal micro-location on market yield and future rental potential. This property offers a unique investment opportunity, especially for those willing to execute a strategic redevelopment plan to unlock its full potential in a growing commercial landscape.",

      "contextDescription": "## Property Information\n\n*Overview of property details, ownership, and certifications*\n\nThe property is situated at Munkegata 25 in the Sluppen district of Trondheim, strategically positioned near the vibrant historical center and the scenic Bakklandet area. This location boasts close proximity to significant landmarks such as the majestic Nidaros Cathedral, NTNU university, and the bustling Solsiden waterfront, establishing it as a key node within a dynamic urban environment characterized by educational institutions, cultural heritage, and modern commercial activity. Access to public transport is facilitated by Trondheim S station, which provides regional rail connections and a direct link to Værnes Airport via airport express services. Furthermore, the comprehensive tram and bus network enhances connectivity, albeit the property suffers from a suboptimal micro-location due to limited visibility and access from the primary thoroughfares, which may affect tenant attraction and foot traffic.\n\nThe property is a six-story office building completed in 1980, notable for its utilitarian architectural style that prioritizes functionality. The gross building area totals approximately 3,450 m² BTA, supported by an owned plot of 1,100 m², designated under the cadastral reference gnr. 410, bnr. 12 in Trondheim municipality. Each office floor offers flexible layouts averaging 570 m², with the inclusion of a ground-level reception area and shared meeting rooms to enhance tenant collaboration. The building is constructed with reinforced concrete, featuring large window facades that provide ample natural light and a modern office environment.\n\nRecent technical upgrades have been implemented to enhance the property's functionality and tenant experience. Key improvements include the installation of a new interior climate control system in 2019, extensive façade renovations completed in 2020, and the modernization of common areas, including restrooms and stairwells, finalized in 2021. These enhancements aim to meet contemporary office standards and improve energy efficiency, although the building currently retains an energy rating of D (orange), highlighting room for further sustainability initiatives.\n\nThe property is governed by the municipal master plan, primarily designated for commercial use, with a strong focus on office and ancillary retail operations. The tenancy structure comprises a diverse mix of tenants, primarily within the professional services sector, including technology firms and consulting agencies, which align with Trondheim's status as a university and tech hub. However, it is important to note that the property's suboptimal micro-location may limit visibility and access, which has implications for leasing performance and market competitiveness. The building currently features a mix of fully leased and partially vacant office spaces, with some units being leased under a seller lease guarantee, providing a degree of income stability.\n\nThe area surrounding Munkegata 25 showcases a blend of historic charm and innovative spirit, reinforced by the presence of SINTEF research organizations and proximity to emerging startups. While the property benefits from solid transport links and significant local amenities, the less-than-ideal micro-location may pose challenges in attracting high-profile tenants, thus influencing the overall market yield. There are no additional environmental certifications, such as BREEAM or LEED, reported in the documentation, which may further impact tenant interest in sustainability-conscious companies.\n\nIn conclusion, Munkegata 25 presents an opportunity for investors to acquire a strategically located office asset within a thriving urban context, albeit with considerations regarding its access and visibility that may affect market performance.",
