This factor may impact the attractiveness of the property to potential tenants, particularly given the competitive office market in Trondheim.\n\nThe property has been owned by the same family for two generations and reflects their commitment to maintaining its quality. However, the seller is highly motivated and desires a quick transaction, which presents an opportunity for prospective buyers to negotiate favorable terms. The current lease structure indicates that the existing tenants hold short leases, with less than three years remaining, potentially leading to transitional vacancy risk as leases expire.\n\nTechnical upgrades have been implemented to enhance the building's functionality and appeal to tenants. Key improvements over the years include the installation of energy-efficient HVAC systems in 2015, enhancing the building's climate control and operational efficiency. In 2018, the façade was refurbished to improve aesthetic appeal and insulation properties, followed by the installation of a new access control system in 2020.

The building rests within a highly sought-after commercial zone, characterized by a mix of historical architecture and modern developments, making it an attractive hub for both office and retail activities. The proximity to NTNU university enhances the area’s appeal as a center for innovation and technology, while the nearby Solsiden waterfront area offers a variety of dining and leisure options. Public transport is highly accessible with Trondheim S station located approximately 800 meters away, providing connections to regional and national rail services, and Værnes Airport is easily reachable via direct bus services. The local tram and bus networks facilitate convenient commuting across the city.\n\nThe property is a well-maintained seven-storey commercial building constructed in 1972, featuring a gross building area of approximately 3,200 m² BTA. The structure is designed with a steel frame and concrete infill, offering robust and flexible office spaces. The cadastral designation is gnr. 216, bnr. 34 in Trondheim municipality, with an owned plot size of 1,000 m². The design includes large window surfaces that allow for abundant natural light, creating an inviting working environment. \n\nIn terms of technical upgrades, the building has seen improvements over the years, including a new roof installation in 2015, modernization of mechanical systems in 2018, and a complete façade refurbishment in 2021. The most recent upgrade, completed in early 2023, included the installation of energy-efficient windows and a new heating system, enhancing the building’s sustainability credentials. The property has an energy rating of D and is in compliance with current environmental regulations.\n\nThe property’s zoning designation in the municipal master plan is primarily \"kontorformål\" (office purposes), complemented by limited retail spaces on the ground floor. Currently, the tenancy structure is predominantly comprised of office users engaged in information technology and professional services, with a small café occupying a section of the ground floor. The aggregated office areas per floor range from approximately 350 m² to 480 m², with a blend of occupied and vacant spaces. Notably, the property has a short lease term of less than three years remaining, which presents both an opportunity and a risk for potential investors, as the remaining lease terms can affect the property’s yield. \n\nThe property has been in the same family ownership for two generations, reflecting a long-standing commitment to the building and its operation. However, the seller is currently highly motivated and seeking a quick transaction, creating an advantageous context for interested buyers. While the property features a mix of income-generating and currently vacant spaces, the specifics of the current vacancy rate and potential lease guarantees are not disclosed in the presentation.\n\nIn summary, Munkegata 22 offers a strategic location within Trondheim’s office market, characterized by strong transport links, proximity to educational and cultural landmarks, and a modernized building that aligns with contemporary office needs. The combination of a motivated seller and a short lease term provides a unique investment opportunity for those looking to capitalize on Trondheim’s growth as a university and tech city.",

The design incorporates open retail spaces on the ground floor, while the upper levels are utilized for additional retail and storage units, providing a flexible layout conducive to various retail formats. \n\nThe property is currently leased to a government-backed tenant, which adds a layer of stability to the investment profile.

Torggata 37 is positioned within a bustling area, surrounded by established regional shopping centres and big-box retail stores, which anchor the local economy and attract a diverse shopper demographic. The immediate vicinity features several well-known retailers, dining establishments, and recreational facilities, contributing to a strong footfall and community engagement. The cadastral designation is gnr. 100, bnr. 45 in Lillestrøm municipality, encompassing an owned plot of 1,250 m².\n\nConstructed in 2002, the property is a single-storey retail building with a gross building area of approximately 1,200 m² BTA. The structure is defined by a modern architectural design featuring large glass façades and an open layout, allowing for flexible retail configurations. The building is constructed using concrete and steel frameworks, ensuring durability and low maintenance. The layout consists of a significant retail space, complemented by service areas and restrooms, making it conducive for both established brands and emerging retailers. \n\nTransport connectivity to the site is robust, with multiple access points from the E6 highway, facilitating ease of movement for both customers and delivery vehicles.

The short remaining lease term for the primary tenant presents both a challenge and an opportunity for prospective buyers looking to enhance the property’s yield through active management and potential redevelopment strategies. Overall, the property stands as a strong candidate for investment in the competitive Norwegian retail market.",
