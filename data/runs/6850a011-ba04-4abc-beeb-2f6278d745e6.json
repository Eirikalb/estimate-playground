      "contextDescription": "## Property Information\n\n*Overview of property details, ownership, and certifications*\n\nThe property is situated at Bogstadveien 123, nestled in the vibrant Majorstuen outskirts of Oslo. This location is characterized by a dynamic retail landscape, featuring an array of local shopping streets and neighborhood centers that cater to a diverse customer base. Bogstadveien, a prominent thoroughfare, is well-known for its mix of international chains and independent retailers, contributing to a stable footfall in the area. The property is conveniently positioned approximately 300 meters from Majorstuen metro station, which serves as a major junction for both metro and tram lines, ensuring excellent public transport connectivity. Additionally, the surrounding streets provide ample on-street parking, enhancing accessibility for both customers and employees.\n\nThe building, originally constructed in 1995, consists of three floors with a total gross building area (BTA) of approximately 1,200 m². The cadastral designation is gnr. 211, bnr. 45 in Oslo municipality, with the plot covering an area of 600 m². This retail property is structured as a reinforced concrete frame, featuring a modern façade with large glass windows, which enhances visibility and natural light within the retail spaces. It offers flexible floor plates averaging 400 m², accommodating a variety of retail layouts and configurations.\n\nDespite its modern design, the property does exhibit certain challenges affecting its market appeal. The micro-location has been characterized by suboptimal access and limited visibility from Bogstadveien, which may deter foot traffic compared to neighboring properties. Additionally, as the building approaches its third decade, it is recognized that capital expenditure (capex) will be necessary to address maintenance issues and to modernize the facility in accordance with contemporary retail standards. Such updates could include façade renovations, upgrading HVAC systems, and enhancing interior finishes.\n\nThe current tenancy structure reveals that the property is subject to a short lease term of less than three years, which presents both opportunities and challenges for prospective investors. While the short lease may allow for re-positioning or redevelopment plans, it also introduces potential vacancy risk and necessitates active management of tenant relations to ensure continued occupancy.\n\nIn terms of technical upgrades, the property has undergone several improvements over the years, including the installation of a new climate control system in 2018, a roof refurbishment in 2019, and an exterior painting project completed in early 2021. These upgrades have contributed to maintaining the building's aesthetics and functionality, yet further enhancements will be vital to remain competitive in the evolving retail market.\n\nThe property’s regulatory framework is guided by the municipal master plan, designating the area for \"bebyggelse og anlegg\" with a focus on retail functions. Its current usage as a retail space aligns with this designation, making it a compliant asset within the municipal context. The immediate vicinity is characterized by a mix of retail, dining, and residential developments, fostering a vibrant community atmosphere that attracts both local residents and visitors.\n\nIn summary, while the property at Bogstadveien 123 offers notable potential due to its location within the bustling Majorstuen retail district, various factors such as its suboptimal micro-location, the need for capital expenditure, and the short remaining lease period must be carefully considered by prospective investors. The evolving landscape of the Oslo retail market, combined with strategic asset management, may provide avenues to enhance the property’s value moving forward.",
