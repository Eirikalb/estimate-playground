Additionally, the suboptimal micro-location (poor access and visibility) would further increase the yield by approximately 15-40 bps due to perceived risk. On the positive side, the BREEAM Excellent or Outstanding certification would compress the yield by 10-20 bps, making the property more attractive to investors. Considering these factors, we start with a benchmark yield for residential properties of 4.25%–6.50%.

However, the suboptimal micro-location with poor access and visibility introduces additional risk factors that would necessitate an upward adjustment. Considering these elements, a yield of 6.25% is justified as it reflects a balance between the positive aspects of tenant diversification and the negative impact of location quality.",

Starting from a benchmark yield of around 6.50% for medium-quality office assets in Stavanger, the BREEAM certification would lower the yield to approximately 6.30% (6.50% - 20 bps), but the micro-location risk pushes it up to 6.00% (6.30% + 30 bps).
