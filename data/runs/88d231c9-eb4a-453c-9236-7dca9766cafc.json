This location benefits from direct access to the E6 and E18 motorways, ensuring seamless connectivity for transportation and distribution. The nearby landmarks include major logistics terminals and distribution centers, solidifying the area’s status as a crucial last-mile distribution hub. Public transport options are robust with close proximity to the Alnabru rail freight terminal, which offers efficient rail services for goods transport, enhancing the property’s appeal to logistics-oriented tenants.\n\nThe building was constructed in 2010 and features a modern warehouse design characterized by high ceilings and spacious layouts. It comprises a single-story structure with a gross building area of approximately 12,500 m² BTA, constructed using a steel frame with insulated panel cladding, optimized for logistics operations. The plot spans approximately 25,000 m² and is designated in the municipal land registry as gnr. 148, bnr. 23 in Oslo municipality. The property’s configuration allows for effective functionality, with loading docks designed for high-volume distribution and ample parking facilities for both staff and freight vehicles.\n\nRecent technical upgrades have further enhanced the property’s operational efficiency.

Currently, the property has an energy rating of C, which aligns with contemporary sustainability standards, although there are no specific certifications such as BREEAM or LEED reported.\n\nThe tenancy structure is characterized by a diversified tenant base comprising multiple logistics and warehousing companies, which mitigates concentration risk. However, there is currently one single SME tenant occupying approximately 60% of the total space, presenting a concentration risk that may impact future rental stability. Additionally, it is important to note that the property is facing an imminent vacancy, as the SME tenant has announced plans to vacate over 20% of the total rental space within the next six months. This situation may present an opportunity for prospective buyers to re-evaluate and reposition the asset within the competitive logistics market.\n\nThe property is zoned under the municipal master plan for logistics and distribution use, ensuring that it is compliant with local regulations for commercial operations in the logistics sector. The current tenant mix is predominantly composed of logistics firms specializing in last-mile delivery and storage solutions, with space allocations effectively designed to support operational efficiencies. The building has been tailored to accommodate the evolving needs of the logistics sector, featuring flexible layouts that allow for easy reconfiguration based on tenant specifications.\n\nIn summary, this property at Lagerveien 8 offers an exceptional opportunity to acquire a modern logistics facility in a highly sought-after location, characterized by strong transportation links, a diversified tenant base with current concentration risk, and the potential for value enhancement through strategic leasing initiatives in light of imminent vacancy.",

      "contextDescription": "## Property Information\n\n*Overview of property details, ownership, and certifications*\n\nThe property is located at Hegdehaugsveien 24 in the vibrant neighborhood of Majorstuen, Oslo. This area is known for its eclectic mix of retail offerings and cultural institutions, making it a popular destination for both locals and visitors. Hegdehaugsveien serves as a significant thoroughfare, positioned approximately 300 meters from the bustling Majorstuen metro station, which connects Line 1, 2, and 3 of the Oslo Metro. The immediate vicinity includes notable landmarks such as the Frogner Park, the Vigeland Sculpture Park, and an array of local cafes and boutique shops that contribute to a strong neighborhood retail character. While public transport accessibility is robust with bus connections nearby and the metro station within walking distance, it is essential to note that the property's micro-location presents suboptimal conditions regarding visibility and access due to its placement slightly set back from the main street.\n\nConstructed in 1985, the building is a four-story retail property with a total gross building area of approximately 1,200 m² BTA. The structure is characterized by a modern concrete façade and large display windows, which enhance the retail experience. The property is situated on a plot of 450 m², designated by the cadastral references gnr. 213, bnr. 45 in Oslo municipality. Its layout offers flexible retail spaces on the ground floor, complemented by storage and office areas on the upper levels. With typical floor plates of around 300 m², the building is well-suited for a variety of retail and service tenants.\n\nIn recent years, the property has undergone significant technical upgrades to enhance its appeal and functionality. Key improvements include the installation of energy-efficient HVAC systems in 2019, a comprehensive façade renovation in 2021, and the modernization of the interior common areas, completed in early 2023. These upgrades not only improve the building's aesthetic appeal but also ensure compliance with contemporary sustainability standards, although the building does not possess formal certifications such as BREEAM or LEED.\n\nRegulated under the municipal master plan for mixed-use development, the property is predominantly utilized for retail purposes, with various independent and chain stores as tenants. The current occupancy rate stands at approximately 85%, with a diverse tenant mix that supports stable footfall and a loyal local customer base. The retail environment is characterized by a blend of established brands and independent retailers, fostering a vibrant shopping experience that attracts both community members and tourists alike. \n\nDespite its positive attributes, the property does face challenges related to its micro-location, notably poor access and reduced visibility from the main thoroughfare. These factors are critical considerations for potential investors, as they may influence foot traffic and overall market performance. \n\nAdding to its allure, the property was recently featured in an architecture magazine for its innovative design and modern adaptations, enhancing its marketability in a competitive retail landscape. \n\nIn conclusion, Hegdehaugsveien 24 represents a compelling opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on the dynamic retail market in Majorstuen, while also addressing the challenges inherent in its suboptimal micro-location. The blend of recent upgrades, a strong tenant mix, and the ongoing appeal of the Majorstuen neighborhood position this property as a noteworthy prospect within Oslo’s commercial real estate landscape.",
