You are estimating market yields for Norwegian commercial real estate.

Here are three example valuations:

**Example 1:**
Property: Office building in Oslo CBD, built 2018, government tenant (Ministry of Finance), 12 years remaining on lease, BREEAM Excellent.
Analysis: Prime CBD location (4.50-5.25% range). Government tenant and long lease = very low risk. Modern building with certification. Position at low end of range, slight compression for quality.
Result: {"yield": 4.50, "reasoning": "Prime CBD, government tenant, long lease, modern certified building - bond-like characteristics justify lowest yields"}

**Example 2:**
Property: Office building in Oslo Lysaker, built 2005, single tenant (mid-sized IT company), 4 years remaining on lease.
Analysis: Lysaker range is 5.50-7.00%. Single corporate tenant with medium lease. Building is 20 years old. Position mid-range, slight expansion for tenant and building factors.
Result: {"yield": 6.50, "reasoning": "Lysaker mid-range positioning, single tenant adds concentration risk, older building needs consideration, medium lease term"}

**Example 3:**
Property: Logistics warehouse outside Bergen, built 1995, three tenants (logistics companies), average 6 years remaining.
Analysis: Logistics Normal range 6.50-9.50%. Diversified tenants good. Old building is concern. Medium lease. Secondary location.
Result: {"yield": 7.75, "reasoning": "Secondary logistics location, older building requiring capex, partially offset by diversified tenant base and reasonable lease terms"}
