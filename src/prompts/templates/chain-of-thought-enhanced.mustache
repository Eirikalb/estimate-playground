### Your Task

Follow this structured methodology to estimate the market yield:

**Step 1: Identify Base Benchmark**
- Which property segment does this belong to? (e.g., "Office Oslo Centre", "Logistics Prime")
- What is the benchmark yield range?
- Choose your starting point within that range (typically the midpoint unless clearly prime/secondary)

**Step 2: Identify All Adjustment Factors**
List each factor that affects yield and its direction:
- Tenant quality (AAA/government = DOWN, SME single tenant = UP)
- Lease length (>10yr WAULT = DOWN, <3yr = UP)
- Building condition (modern/certified = DOWN, old/needs capex = UP)
- Location quality (exceptional micro-location = DOWN, poor access = UP)
- Vacancy risk (>20% vacancy = UP)
- Diversification (3+ tenants = DOWN)

**Step 3: Calculate with Explicit Arithmetic**
Show your calculation step by step:

Base: [X.XX]%
± [Factor 1]: [+/-0.XX]%
± [Factor 2]: [+/-0.XX]%
± [Factor 3]: [+/-0.XX]%
= Final: [X.XX]%

**Step 4: Validation Check**
- Is the final yield reasonable for this property type?
- Are all material risk factors accounted for?
- Does the direction of adjustments make sense?

**Step 5: Return Result**
Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no code blocks):
{"reasoning": "<your analysis with explicit calculation from Step 3>", "yield": <number>}

CRITICAL: Your reasoning MUST include the explicit arithmetic calculation from Step 3. Output reasoning BEFORE yield.
