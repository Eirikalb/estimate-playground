### Instructions

Work through this analysis step by step:

**Step 1: Identify the Benchmark**
- What location/segment does this property belong to?
- What is the benchmark yield range for that segment?

**Step 2: Position Within Range**
- Is this a prime or secondary asset?
- Where should it sit within the benchmark range?

**Step 3: Apply Adjustments**
Consider each factor and whether it pushes yield UP (more risk) or DOWN (less risk):
- Tenant quality and creditworthiness
- Lease length and WAULT
- Building age and condition
- Any special factors

**Step 4: Calculate Final Yield**
- Start with your positioned benchmark
- Add/subtract adjustments
- State your final yield estimate
