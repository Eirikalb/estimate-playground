These properties command 25-50 bps lower yields.\n- **Medium leases (5-10 years)** represent the market norm and typically trade at benchmark yields.\n- **Short leases (<3 years remaining)** add significant re-letting risk. Expect 25-75 bps premium to compensate for vacancy risk and leasing costs.\n\nWAULT (Weighted Average Unexpired Lease Term) should be calculated across all tenants, weighted by rental income."

In a falling rate environment, prime assets may see further compression."
