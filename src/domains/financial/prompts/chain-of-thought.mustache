### Instructions

Work through this analysis step by step using the formula above:

**Step 1: Identify Base Rate**
- What type of company is this? (SaaS Startup/Scale-up/Enterprise, Healthcare, Fintech, etc.)
- What is the base growth rate for this company type?

**Step 2: Calculate NRR Adjustment**
- What is the company's NRR (Net Revenue Retention)?
- Apply the appropriate adjustment: +15% (>=130%), +10% (120-129%), +5% (110-119%), +0% (100-109%), -10% (90-99%), -20% (<90%)

**Step 3: Calculate Market Adjustments**
- Is the company expanding into new markets? (+12%)
- Is the company exiting/consolidating markets? (-15%)
- Is there macro headwind? (-8%)
- Is there macro tailwind? (+6%)

**Step 4: Calculate Operational Adjustments**
- Has the sales team doubled? (+10%)
- Are there sales challenges (high turnover, low quota attainment)? (-12%)
- Is a major product launch imminent? (+8%)
- Is there price pressure from competition? (-6%)

**Step 5: Sum All Components**
Final Growth Rate = Base + NRR Adjustment + Market Adjustments + Operational Adjustments
