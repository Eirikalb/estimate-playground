### Your Task

Follow this structured methodology to estimate the annual revenue growth rate:

**Step 1: Identify Base Benchmark**
- What company stage and industry is this? (e.g., "SaaS Scale-up", "Fintech Startup")
- What is the benchmark growth rate range?
- Choose your starting point within that range (typically the midpoint unless clearly high/low performer)

**Step 2: Identify All Adjustment Factors**
List each factor that affects growth and its direction:
- NRR/Retention (>120% = UP, <90% = DOWN)
- Sales capacity (scaling team = UP, turnover/issues = DOWN)
- Market expansion (new markets = UP, exits = DOWN)
- Product innovation (launches = UP, delays/gaps = DOWN)
- Macro conditions (tailwinds = UP, headwinds = DOWN)
- Pricing dynamics (increases = UP, pressure = DOWN)

**Step 3: Calculate with Explicit Arithmetic**
Show your calculation step by step:

Base: [XX]%
± [Factor 1]: [+/-X]%
± [Factor 2]: [+/-X]%
± [Factor 3]: [+/-X]%
= Final: [XX]%

**Step 4: Validation Check**
- Is the growth rate reasonable for this company type?
- Are all material factors accounted for?
- Does it pass a "smell test" for the industry?

**Step 5: Return Result**
Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no code blocks):
{"reasoning": "<your analysis with explicit calculation from Step 3>", "growth_rate": <number>}

CRITICAL: Your reasoning MUST include the explicit arithmetic calculation from Step 3. Output reasoning BEFORE growth_rate.
