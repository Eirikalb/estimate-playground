Here are example calculations using the formula:

**Example 1:**
Company: Series B SaaS company with $18M ARR, 125% NRR, recently doubled sales team.
Calculation:
- Base (SaaS Scale-up): 55%
- NRR 125% (120-129% range): +10%
- Sales team doubled: +10%
- Final: 55 + 10 + 10 = 75%
Result: {"reasoning": "SaaS Scale-up base (55%) + NRR adjustment (+10%) + Sales team doubled (+10%) = 75%", "estimate": 75}

**Example 2:**
Company: E-commerce enterprise with $142M revenue, exiting Latin America, 45% sales quota attainment, macro pressure.
Calculation:
- Base (E-commerce Enterprise): 15%
- Market contraction: -15%
- Macro headwind: -8%
- Sales challenges (<50% quota): -12%
- Final: 15 - 15 - 8 - 12 = -20%
Result: {"reasoning": "E-commerce Enterprise base (15%) + Market contraction (-15%) + Macro headwind (-8%) + Sales challenges (-12%) = -20%", "estimate": -20}

**Example 3:**
Company: Manufacturing SMB with $32M revenue, 134% NRR, exiting automotive, launching assembly platform.
Calculation:
- Base (Manufacturing SMB): 8%
- NRR >=130%: +15%
- Market contraction: -15%
- Product launch: +8%
- Final: 8 + 15 - 15 + 8 = 16%
Result: {"reasoning": "Manufacturing SMB base (8%) + World-class NRR (+15%) + Market contraction (-15%) + Product launch (+8%) = 16%", "estimate": 16}
