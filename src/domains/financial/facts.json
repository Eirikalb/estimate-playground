      "content": "### Rule of 40 Context\n\nThe Rule of 40 states that a healthy SaaS company's growth rate + profit margin should exceed 40%.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Growth Rate 80%, Margin -40%: Score = 40 (acceptable for early stage)\n- Growth Rate 30%, Margin 15%: Score = 45 (healthy scale-up)\n- Growth Rate 10%, Margin 25%: Score = 35 (slightly below, mature company)\n\n**Implications for Growth Estimates:**\n- Companies below Rule of 40 may face valuation pressure\n- Pressure often leads to growth investment cuts\n- Or margin improvement at expense of growth\n\n**Typical Trade-offs by Stage:**\n- Seed/A: 80%+ growth, deep negative margins acceptable\n- B/C: 50%+ growth, path to breakeven expected\n- D+/Growth: 30%+ growth, near-breakeven or profitable\n- Public: 20%+ growth, positive margins expected"
